"""The mounted MCP surface stays cheap by construction.

Two measured levers are pinned here:

1. Operator ``*_selfcheck`` diagnostics must not be MCP tools — they exist for
   ``marketplace-mcp doctor`` and cost ~7.5k wire tokens when advertised.
2. ``outputSchema`` must stay compact (top-level field names only): full
   Pydantic output trees were measured at ~24.5k tokens, 64% of the unified
   server's original per-request cost.

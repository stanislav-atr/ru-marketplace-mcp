"""Authenticated transport: drive the operator's own Chrome over CDP.

Several Russian marketplaces reject datacenter TLS fingerprints outright — Ozon
answers ``composer-api.bx`` with an endless 307 ``__rr`` redirect loop, and
others gate catalog reads behind a session cookie. The reliable answer is not a
better fingerprint: it is to run the fetch *inside* a real browser the operator
already trusts. This module connects to a Chrome started with
``--remote-debugging-port`` and reuses that live session.

=== THREAT MODEL — READ BEFORE USING ===

CDP hands any local caller full control of the profile it is attached to,
including every logged-in session in it. The mitigations, in order of value:

1. **Dedicated profile.** ``CHROME_SCRAPING_PROFILE`` defaults to a scraping-only
   directory, never the operator's daily profile. Log into marketplaces there
   and nothing else — banking and email stay out of blast radius.
2. **Localhost binding.** Chrome is launched with
   ``--remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1``; the port is never exposed to a LAN.
3. **Scheme guard.** ``open_page`` refuses anything but http(s), so an
   authenticated browser can never be aimed at ``file:///``.
4. **Caller-side host allowlists.** Each connector validates its own URLs before
   they reach this module — that is what stops a crafted SKU from turning into a
   request for ``/api/personal/orders``.

No credentials are ever stored, read, or transmitted by this code: the operator
logs in by hand, in a browser they control.

Cross-platform: Chrome binaries and profile locations are resolved per platform
(Windows / macOS / Linux). Window-hiding stealth exists on Windows (window parked
off-screen) and macOS (tabs opened in the background, app kept hidden); on Linux
the browser launches normally, or headless when ``CHROME_HEADLESS=1``.

    ``mcp_core.transport.cdp_budget`` — bounded globally, serialized per host,
    with a breaker that drops a host which keeps answering 4xx.

    The permit covers the navigation, not the page: it is released as soon as
    the document is up, because a caller may hold the yielded page for minutes
    (a retained challenge page waits for a human). Holding a host's slot for

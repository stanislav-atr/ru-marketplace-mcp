"""Cross-marketplace price comparison.

The other connectors each answer "what does this cost on X". This one answers the
question people actually ask — "where is this cheapest right now" — by querying
every installed marketplace concurrently and normalising the answers into one
ranked list.

Three design decisions worth stating, because they are what make the output
trustworthy:

**Partial results beat no results.** Russian marketplaces fail independently and
often: Ozon rejects datacenter IPs, Yandex occasionally answers 302, Detsky Mir
emits sporadic 502s. One source failing must never sink the comparison, so every
source is queried in parallel and its outcome reported per-source. A caller can
always see which marketplaces answered and which did not.

**Subscription prices are never silently compared against everyday prices.**
Yandex Market leads with a Plus-subscriber price 25-30% below the everyday one.
Ranking that against a Wildberries price would fabricate a bargain. Comparison
uses everyday prices; subscriber prices ride along in a separate field.

**Sources are optional at import time.** Ozon pulls in curl_cffi and Playwright,
which many users do not want. Each connector is imported defensively, and the
comparison runs with whatever is present.

NEVER write to stdout in a stdio MCP server — it corrupts JSON-RPC.

    the tool for "where is X cheapest" — running the per-marketplace search tools
    one at a time gives the same data far more slowly and without the ranking.

    Two things to read carefully in the output:

    - `cheapest` is chosen on everyday prices. Yandex Market's subscriber price
      appears as `price_with_subscription_rub` and is deliberately excluded from
      ranking, since it requires a paid Yandex Plus subscription.
    - `source_outcomes` shows which marketplaces answered. A blocked or timed-out
      source means the comparison is partial, not that the product is absent
      there — `complete` tells you which case you are in.

    Titles are matched loosely: marketplaces name things differently, so scan the
    results rather than assuming every row is the identical model.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `lamoda_search` takes Lamoda's own filters — `gender`, `colors`, `brands`,
  `sizes`, `sort`, `page`, `limit` — and reads the page's Nuxt state instead of
  the tiles: items now carry the real brand, the colour family, sizes in stock
  and a photo URL, and the response carries `total_found`, `pages`,
  `filters_applied` and `facets` (colours, sizes, top brands with counts).
  Colours accept Lamoda's titles, English names and Russian adjective forms
  ("navy", "синяя", "оливковые" → хаки); an unknown colour is `bad_request`,
  never silently dropped. Brand names resolve through the page's brand facet.
  The DOM tiles remain the fallback, flagged `dom_fallback`.
- `lamoda_images` returns up to 12 products' photos as MCP images, each
  labelled with SKU, brand and colour, so a vision-capable model can judge
  style — the step that titles alone cannot do.
- `lamoda_card(detail=true)` reads the product page: colour, gallery,
  description, composition and season, per-size stock with body
  measurements, the same model in other colours, and the review rating.
- The Lamoda skill documents a capsule → shortlist workflow: one filtered
  search per garment slot, photos before choosing, detailed cards for
  finalists, a per-slot shortlist for the operator's cart.

### Changed

- Lamoda prices separate the everyday price from the Lamoda Club member price
  (`loyalty_price_rub`), the same rule as Yandex Plus. Search previously read
  the displayed Club price as `price_rub`.
- `lamoda_card` falls back to the product page when the GraphQL endpoint is
  refused (HTTP 403 "Запрос отклонен" observed 2026-09-24 while the same host
  rendered in Chrome), and `lamoda_selfcheck` reports one `card` check that is
  healthy when either tier answers, probing the page with a SKU the live
  search just returned. A GraphQL parser drift is now reported as drift; the
  old check read the exception class name and could never see it.
- `compare_prices` receives Lamoda's stock status and brand, so
  `in_stock_only` no longer excludes every Lamoda offer as unknown.

### Fixed

- Wildberries reads `card.wb.ru`, `search.wb.ru` and `catalog.wb.ru` through
  browser impersonation. Those three answer the default client's TLS handshake
  with a 403 HTML page on a network where curl and curl_cffi get a 200 from the
  identical URL, so `wb_card` and `wb_category_products` failed outright while
  `wb_search` fell through to the legacy stale-id path and returned unrelated
  products instead of an error. Hosts without the gate, including `feedbacks2.wb.ru`
  on the same apex, keep the shared budget and retry path.
- Comparison preserves native source warnings alongside valid offers, including
  fallback extraction, missing fields, coupon pricing, and result truncation.
  Successful source access no longer hides those data-quality limitations.
- The nightly live canary no longer shares a concurrency slot with pushes to
  `main`: the group carries the event name and a scheduled run is never
  cancelled, so a routine commit can no longer delete the only automatic live
  evidence, and the canary can no longer cancel a merge verification. The
  contract is pinned by `scripts/test_ci_concurrency.py`.
- Wildberries refusals now reach the request pacer, so the longer post-refusal
  gap applies and the "standing block, not a blip" hint can reach an operator;
  an HTML wall page served with HTTP 200 counts as a refusal instead of being
  cached as a success. `wb_selfcheck` probes `search.wb.ru` v9 directly, so a
  refusal of the primary search path is visible rather than hiding behind the
  legacy fallback's answers.
- The impersonated transport streams its body through the same cap as the shared
  path, and the gated-host note records the dated re-measurement: the 403s did
  not reproduce from a different address, while impersonation remained the
  difference on `catalog.wb.ru`.
- Transport failures name the exception class instead of surfacing an empty
  detail, and Detsky Mir reports an HTTP 418 from its edge as an address block
  rather than an unexplained status. A dated [live record](docs/LIVE_STATUS.md)
  states what was verified against the marketplaces, and the Detsky Mir note in
  `docs/ANTI_BOT.md` carries the dated correction.
- The gated Wildberries hosts prefer impersonation and fall back once to the
  shared client, because a second measurement showed the split is not a property
  of the host: from one address the impersonated path timed out on the primary
  search endpoint while the shared client answered it, and from the next
  `card.wb.ru` refused both. Canary probes read past the cache, so a `healthy`
  verdict cannot describe a read that already happened.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Yandex search keeps distinct reported SKUs within a product family before
  applying its result limit, including zone payloads with no `wareId`.
- Comparison preserves unknown Wildberries quantities as unknown stock and
  interprets Ozon availability conservatively: negative labels cannot win an
  in-stock-only comparison, and pack sizes or ambiguous counts remain unknown.
- Doctor retains failure explanations supplied through a canary's `detail`
  or `notes` when no standard `reason` is present, including Yandex empty-card
  responses; healthy checks stay terse.

- Operator CLI: installation includes AliExpress and optional MPStats; doctor
  includes AliExpress, accepts documented source aliases, and rejects invalid
  arguments before querying sources. Unknown subcommands no longer start a
  waiting stdio server.
- Comparison and shortlist inspection share the native card dispatcher:
  Megamarket receives the correct argument, and Wildberries/Detsky Mir IDs and
  canonical URLs use the same validation in both profiles.
- Sources deliberately excluded by `MARKETPLACE_SOURCES` are distinguished from
  missing installations and do not make default comparisons falsely partial.
- Startup, wire-budget, and Docker probes enforce response deadlines, drain
  stderr, reject JSON-RPC errors, and clean up their processes. The local stdio
  gate now checks the running release version and complete source inventory.
- A failed pytest collection cannot satisfy the documented-test-count gate.
  Operational regression tests run in CI, Node tests use the lockfile, and the
  pre-commit Ruff version matches the workspace lock.

### Documentation

- Added a task-oriented [first-query guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) covering client
  setup, targeted diagnostics, offer verification, and access limitations.
- Updated the release checklist to cover sixteen servers and 32 artifacts.
- Standalone installation uses GitHub Release wheels or a source checkout,
  rather than unavailable PyPI package names. The comparison `all` extra now
  includes AliExpress; instructions retain the explicit AliExpress install
  needed by the previously published v2.4.1 wheels.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-09-18

**Withdrawn: 2.4.0.** Its source distributions carried third-party personal data in
the test fixtures — two Yandex reviewer accounts (including one encoded inside a
base64 protobuf) and three named private individuals from Cian listings, with
account ids and a resolvable agent profile URL. The fixtures are scrubbed here, and
the 2.4.0 release and tag were withdrawn rather than left downloadable.

### Fixed

- Fixture privacy: the reviewer identity in `card_washer.html` is masked in all four
  carriers (`uidPublicId`, `avatarMediaId`, `analyticsData.uid`, and the
  `authorComplaintContext` protobuf that encoded the same UID); the Cian fixtures no
  longer name private realtors, while agency records stay as business data.
- Provenance prose no longer points at the operator's private capture workspace, and
  the fixture pins are recomputed.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` now documents nine error codes, not eight - `challenge_required`
  was missing from a contract integrators branch on.
- `CDP_SETUP.md` lists Cian among the sources that need a browser, and the CDP-only
  set is six, not five.
- `DEEP_RESEARCH_V2.0.0.md` carries a superseded notice: the four security items it
  listed as open work all shipped since (`a7b3f86`, `ca846fe`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-18 — WITHDRAWN (see 2.4.1)

### Reliability

- CDP navigations are bounded: at most three in flight process-wide and one per
  host, with a per-host breaker that pauses a host after repeated refusals instead
  of letting the rest of a fan-out queue behind it. The budget covers the
  navigation, not the page - a retained challenge page waits for a human and must
  not hold its host's slot.
- Refusal backoff is jittered, so sources refused at the same moment no longer
  retry in lockstep.
- The browser-handoff registry holds eight leases, bounds a lease by lifetime
  (900 s, never extended by a retry) and by idleness (600 s), and the handle issuer
  and consumer now agree on what "live" means.

### Reporting

- A resumed read says what happened: whether the retained page was resumed,
  whether the challenge cleared, and whether the data moved (tri-state - "nothing
  to compare with" is not "nothing changed"), compared by digest rather than by
  keeping the payload.
- Refusals explain themselves: busy names the reason and a retry hint, a full
  registry says so, and a caller's own expired handle says it expired while a
  foreign handle stays opaque.

### Correctness

- Yandex zone snippets are found with a quote-aware tag scanner; a raw `>` inside
  an attribute value no longer makes a snippet disappear from the parse.
- The routing-eval runner's verdict is machine-checkable: a partial run is not
  `ok`, missing answers count as failed, and the exit code follows the verdict.

### Privacy

- Fixtures no longer carry third-party contact phone numbers, a logged-in account
  nick, per-request identifiers, reviewer display names, account ids or order
  numbers; the operator's egress IP was replaced with documentation space.
- Every fixture pin is verified against its file by a CI gate.

### Tooling

- `scripts/check_provenance.py` checks all fixture pins and refuses to let a
  quarantined pin stay quarantined once it matches again.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-13

- `compare_browser_snapshot(handoff_id)` exposes the retained browser viewport as
  standard MCP image content for native-vision clients. The handle is bound to the
  MCP session and lease expiry; no OCR or external vision service is invoked.
- DSH profile selection is mutually exclusive (`full > decision > compare`), and
  the stored wire baselines cover all three profiles.
- Offer verification now selects the requested WB row, unwraps Detsky Mir cards,
  checks Ozon's regular price, and can require the Yandex search-row `sku_id`
  before comparing a card price. Seller article fields remain non-MPN evidence.
- WB preserves unambiguous typed color evidence. MPN/GTIN remain `unknown` when
  the source does not provide manufacturer identifiers.

### Browser recovery

- Optional `CHROME_CHALLENGE_HANDOFF_S` retains DOM-detected Lamoda search and
  Taobao search/card challenge tabs. Same-session repeats read the owned page
  without navigating again. Expiry is capped at 300 seconds from initial attach,
  does not extend, and at most four leases are active. Error/comparison metadata
  exposes `handoff_expires_at` and an opaque `handoff_id` only when retained.
- New `compare_browser_snapshot(handoff_id)` returns a bounded JPEG viewport and
  capture metadata through standard MCP image content. It never navigates or
  invokes an OCR/vision service; a capable MCP client can use its own native
  vision. Handles are same-session and expire with the retained lease.
- DSH mounts exactly one profile with precedence full, decision, compare. This
  fixes duplicate compare/decision mounts and the full+decision flag conflict.
- The snapshot tool costs 370 wire tokens in the stored baseline; the profiles it
  belongs to total compare 2023, decision 2278, unified 16549
  (`work/performance/wire-baseline.json`, enforced by the CI wire gate). Baselines and the public tool contract were
  updated for this addition; CI now gates the middle profile too.
- Owned tabs close on success, failure, expiry, caller cancellation and graceful
  shutdown. Active handoffs suppress profile hiding; owned-window foreground
  activation is best-effort. Default behavior, browser-less compare installations,
  and headless operation retain their existing behavior. Hard process-kill expiry
  and HTTP failures rejected before DOM extraction are outside this feature.
- Raw CDP now attempts bounded cleanup of its exact owned target even when
  target discovery or page-websocket attachment fails. Cancellation and cleanup
  errors preserve the original failure. Concurrent ownership tests now use six
  distinct targets and a foreign tab rather than a single shared fake target.
- Taobao search/card failures no longer enter the successful-result cache, and
  Lamoda search does not cache detected challenge pages. After browser action,
  a new call reads fresh evidence instead of replaying a cached block for up to
  the default 120-second TTL. Successful payloads still use the normal cache.
- Taobao search now uses its existing CAPTCHA detector in the public tool, not
  only in selfcheck. Empty cards with challenge evidence return the same
  structured error; ordinary product cards mentioning CAPTCHA remain data.
- Taobao login/CAPTCHA walls and Lamoda search challenges return
  `challenge_required`. Comparison outcomes now retain `error_code`, `retryable`,
  `requires_user_action`, and `challenge_type`, even when error detail is truncated.
  Successful sources remain available while the client waits for browser action.
- DSH guidance retries only affected sources after action completes, preserving
  query settings and disclosing that old and retried offers have different
  observation times. Opt-in retention now supports explicit same-session repeats;
  autonomous challenge completion remains outside this implementation.
- Corrected the documented offline-test count that failed the previous CI run.

### Идентификация / Identity

- `compare_verify_offer` принимает необязательный `expected_identity` и
  возвращает сведения из карточки вместе с вердиктом сопоставления. Артикул
  продавца не считается MPN; совпадение MPN требует марки. Отсутствующие
  характеристики варианта дают `unknown`, кириллические и китайские значения
  сохраняются при сопоставлении. Проверка формата GTIN отклоняет знаки,
  дробные числа и нулевой заполнитель; ведущие нули до 14 знаков не меняют
  идентичность GTIN. Проверка не меняет ранжирование цен; извлечение
  manufacturer-полей из живых источников ещё не подтверждено.
- `compare_verify_offer` accepts optional `expected_identity` and returns
  observed card evidence with a match verdict. Seller articles are not MPNs;
  MPN equality requires a brand. Incomplete variant evidence stays `unknown`,
  and non-Latin variant values retain their meaning. Malformed GTINs are
  rejected and leading-zero GTIN representations compare equally. Price
  ranking is unchanged; live manufacturer-field extraction remains unverified.
- The deliberate optional-input expansion adds about 196 estimated tokens:
  compare profile 1816 → 2023; unified profile 16030 → 16549 (values as stored in `work/performance/wire-baseline.json`). The stored
  wire baseline is updated for this contract change; the 10% gate is unchanged.

### Исправлено

- Lamoda больше не принимает слова `captcha` и «не робот» внутри скриптов,
  скрытых виджетов или названий товаров за блокировку; challenge определяется
  только по видимому тексту пустой выдачи.
- Параллельные CDP-коннекторы теперь сопоставляют созданную вкладку с её
  `targetId`, чтобы один вызов не получил вкладку другого.
- В CI добавлен гейт роста MCP wire-схем относительно сохранённого baseline.
- Кэш адреса Megamarket теперь разделён по CDP endpoint и scraping profile;
  смена профиля не использует старый адресный идентификатор.
- Добавлена датированная матрица model-level routing с отдельной проверкой
  text/structured capability и явной оговоркой, что one-shot probe не является
  универсальным рейтингом моделей.
- Яндекс Маркет: «полая» страница товара (HTTP 200, `pageId market:product`,
  все товарные коллекции пусты, нет Product ld+json) классифицируется как
  `empty_product_shell` → retryable `transport_down` у `yandex_card` и
  `inconclusive` у selfcheck, а не `parser_drift`. Причина живая: ~12–13.09
  Яндекс перевёл товарные данные поиска и карточек из SSR-состояния в
  клиентскую ленивую загрузку — знакомые семейства полей не изменили форму,
  они отсутствуют в отдаче, а по тристейт-доктрине это сервинг/сессия, не
  парсер. Search-канарейка больше не считает выдачу через ld+json-fallback
  (`ok_ldjson_only`) здоровой: probe-id для карточной проверки из такой
  выдачи ненадёжен.
- Model-level routing eval стал запускаемым: бандл из 38 кейсов
  (`work/evals/routing-cases-v1.json`, 19 routing + 19 классификаций сбоев,
  каждый с evidence-цитатой из SKILL.md), детерминированный офлайн-раннер
  `scripts/model_routing_eval.py run` (оценивает уже собранные ответы моделей,
  accuracy per-slice, «не схлопывать в одну оценку»), протокол
  мульти-модельного прогона `work/evals/MODEL_ROUTING_PROTOCOL.md` и
  single-model пилот `work/evals/pilot-2026-09-13.md`.

### Fixed

- Lamoda no longer treats `captcha` or bot wording in scripts, hidden widgets,
  or product names as a block; a challenge is classified only from visible text
  on an empty result.
- Concurrent CDP connectors now correlate a created page with its `targetId`,
  preventing one call from claiming another call's tab.
- CI now gates MCP schema wire-cost growth against the stored baseline.
- Megamarket address caching is now scoped to the CDP endpoint and scraping
  profile, so switching profiles cannot reuse the previous address identifier.
- Added a dated model-level routing matrix with separate text/structured
  capability checks; the one-shot probe is explicitly not a universal model ranking.
- Yandex Market: a hollow product page (HTTP 200, `pageId market:product`,
  every product collection empty, no Product ld+json) is now classified as
  `empty_product_shell` — a retryable `transport_down` from `yandex_card` and
  `inconclusive` in the selfcheck, not `parser_drift`. Live cause: around
  Sep 12–13 Yandex moved search/card product data from the SSR state into
  client-side lazy loading — the familiar field families did not change
  shape, they are absent from the served page, which the tri-state doctrine
  classes as serving/session, not the parser. The search canary no longer
  treats an ld+json-fallback extraction (`ok_ldjson_only`) as healthy: a
  card-probe id taken from such a page is unreliable.
- The model-level routing eval is now runnable: a 38-case bundle
  (`work/evals/routing-cases-v1.json`, 19 routing + 19 failure-classification
  cases, each with an evidence citation from SKILL.md), a deterministic offline
  runner `scripts/model_routing_eval.py run` (scores already-collected model
  answers, per-slice accuracy, never collapsed into one score), the
  multi-model run protocol `work/evals/MODEL_ROUTING_PROTOCOL.md`, and a
  single-model pilot `work/evals/pilot-2026-09-13.md`.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-09-11

### Добавлено

- `cian_search` умеет посуточную аренду: `deal="daily"` (рядом с `sale` и
  `rent`). Это отдельный рынок Циана — тот же `_type`, но `for_day: "1"` вместо
  `"!1"`; замер 2026-09-10 по Москве: 25 411 длительных квартир против 53 441
  суточной, а без флага выдача их смешивает. Работает для квартир, комнат и
  домов; коммерции посуточно у Циана нет, и такой запрос отклоняется как
  `bad_request`, а не отдаёт пустую страницу под видом «сегодня ничего нет».
- Новое поле `price_unit` в выдаче и карточке: `total` (продажа), `month`
  (длительная аренда) или `day` (посуточно). У суточных объявлений Циан не
  заполняет ни `paymentPeriod`, ни `leaseTermType` и не отдаёт `priceRur` —
  без явной единицы 5 000 ₽ за ночь читались бы как более дешёвое предложение,
  чем 90 000 ₽ за месяц.

- Коннектор Циан (`cian-connector`, скрипт `cian-mcp`, тулы `cian_search` и
  `cian_card`) — недвижимость, а не товары: квартиры, комнаты, дома и коммерция
  на продажу и в долгосрочную аренду. Только второй ярус (CDP): WAF Циана режет
  голый HTTP по IP (403 `cian_waf_block`, без капчи), а из сессии Chrome
  отвечает собственный JSON-API сайта (`search-offers-desktop`) и состояние
  карточки в `window._cianConfig`. Поиск по фильтрам (сделка, тип, регион,
  комнаты, цена, площадь), не по тексту; регионы 1/2/4593/4588 проверены живьём.
  Карточка отдаёт цену и её историю, планировку, дом, адрес, метро, описание и
  публикатора. Цена без указания — `None`, не 0. В `compare_prices` источник не
  участвует. Страница агента структурированных данных не отдаёт, поэтому тула
  `cian_agent` нет — агент приходит внутри карточки (`docs/ANTI_BOT.md` § Cian).
- Переменная `MARKETPLACE_SOURCES` выбирает, какие источники монтирует
  `marketplace-mcp`: схемы всех тулов уходят клиенту в каждом запросе, и
  оператор, которому нужны три площадки, не платит за остальные. Имена
  канонические, псевдонимы `wb`, `ym`/`yandex`, `detmir`, `ali` тоже
  принимаются. Не задана или пуста — монтируется всё, как раньше. Снятые
  источники видны в `marketplace_sources` → `skipped` с пометкой
  `deselected`, а `compare_prices` опрашивает тот же набор.

### Исправлено

- `marketplace_sources`: флаг `mounted` в `capabilities` у Яндекс Маркета и
  Детского мира всегда был `false`, даже когда они смонтированы, — таблица
  монтирования называет их `yandex`/`detmir`, а метаданные —
  `yandex_market`/`detsky_mir`.
- `MARKETPLACE_SOURCES` теперь отклоняет неизвестные имена при запуске и
  перечисляет поддерживаемые источники: опечатка больше не создаёт частичный
  сервер молча.

### Added

- `cian_search` covers daily rent: `deal="daily"` alongside `sale` and `rent`.
  It is a separate Cian market — same `_type`, `for_day: "1"` instead of `"!1"`;
  measured in Moscow on 2026-09-10: 25 411 long-term flats against 53 441 daily
  ones, and dropping the flag mixes them. Flats, rooms and houses only; Cian has
  no daily commercial market, so that pair is refused as `bad_request` rather
  than returning an empty page that reads as "nothing free today".
- New `price_unit` field on search rows and cards: `total` (sale), `month`
  (long-term rent) or `day` (daily). Cian fills in neither `paymentPeriod` nor
  `leaseTermType` on daily offers and omits `priceRur` there, so without an
  explicit unit a 5 000 ₽ night would read as cheaper than a 90 000 ₽ month.
- Cian connector (`cian-connector`, `cian-mcp` console script, tools
  `cian_search` and `cian_card`) — real estate, not goods: flats, rooms, houses
  and commercial property for sale or long-term rent. Tier 2 only: Cian's WAF
  blocks plain HTTP by IP (403 `cian_waf_block`, no captcha), while inside the
  Chrome session the site's own JSON API (`search-offers-desktop`) and the card
  state in `window._cianConfig` answer. Search is by filters (deal, type,
  region, rooms, price, area), not text; regions 1/2/4593/4588 verified live.
  The card carries the price and its history, layout, building, address, metro,
  description and publisher. A missing price is `None`, never 0. The source
  takes no part in `compare_prices`. The agent page exposes no structured data,
  so there is no `cian_agent` tool — the agent ships inside the card
  (`docs/ANTI_BOT.md` § Cian).
- `MARKETPLACE_SOURCES` selects which sources `marketplace-mcp` mounts: every
  tool schema is sent to the client on every request, so an operator who needs
  three marketplaces does not pay for the rest. Canonical names, plus the
  aliases `wb`, `ym`/`yandex`, `detmir` and `ali`. Unset or blank mounts
  everything, as before. Deselected sources appear in `marketplace_sources` →
  `skipped` marked `deselected`, and `compare_prices` queries the same subset.

### Fixed

- `marketplace_sources`: the `mounted` flag in `capabilities` always read
  `false` for Yandex Market and Detsky Mir, even when mounted — the mount table
  names them `yandex`/`detmir`, the metadata `yandex_market`/`detsky_mir`.
- `MARKETPLACE_SOURCES` now rejects unknown names at startup and lists the
  supported sources, so a typo cannot silently create a partial server.

### Исправлено

- `marketplace-connector` теперь объявляет `aliexpress-connector` жёсткой
  зависимостью: отдельный wheel unified-сервера больше не теряет AliExpress
  молча. `_mount_all` монтирует его с момента появления коннектора, но строк в
  `[project].dependencies` и `[tool.uv.sources]` не было — вне ворксплейса
  источник исчезал из mount, и единственной уликой оставался
  `marketplace_sources.skipped`. PR #47 повторил ту же ошибку с
  `cian-connector`, и её поймали только на ревью.
- Новый тест dependency-parity
  (`packages/marketplace-connector/tests/test_dependency_parity.py`) роняет
  офлайн-набор, если источник из `_mount_all` не объявлен в зависимостях
  пакета или в `[tool.uv.sources]` — и в обратную сторону тоже. Класс ошибки
  «зарегистрирован в _mount_all, забыт в pyproject» теперь закрыт гейтом, а не
  памятью ревьюера.
- `scripts/test_ops_gates.py` получил `__main__`-раннер: задокументированная
  команда `uv run python scripts/test_ops_gates.py` раньше выходила с кодом 0,
  не выполнив ни одного из своих трёх тестов, — гейт, который не может упасть,
  ничего не проверяет. Теперь команда прогоняет тесты через pytest и
  пробрасывает настоящий код возврата; `uv run pytest scripts/test_ops_gates.py`
  работает как прежде.

### Fixed

- `marketplace-connector` now declares `aliexpress-connector` as a hard
  dependency, so a standalone unified-server wheel no longer silently drops
  AliExpress. `_mount_all` has mounted it since the connector landed, but the
  rows in `[project].dependencies` and `[tool.uv.sources]` were missing —
  outside the workspace the source vanished from the mount, and the only
  evidence was `marketplace_sources.skipped`. PR #47 repeated the same mistake
  with `cian-connector`, caught only in review.
- A new dependency-parity test
  (`packages/marketplace-connector/tests/test_dependency_parity.py`) fails the
  offline suite if a source mounted by `_mount_all` is missing from the package
  dependencies or from `[tool.uv.sources]` — and in the reverse direction too.
  The "registered in _mount_all, forgotten in pyproject" bug class is now a
  gate, not a reviewer's memory.
- `scripts/test_ops_gates.py` gained a `__main__` runner: the documented
  invocation `uv run python scripts/test_ops_gates.py` used to exit 0 without
  executing any of its three tests — a gate that cannot fail checks nothing.
  It now runs them through pytest and propagates the real exit code;
  `uv run pytest scripts/test_ops_gates.py` keeps working unchanged.

### Изменено

- Офлайн-счётчик тестов в документации обновлён до 1315: четыре теста
  dependency-parity добавились к 1311. Заодно вычищен дрейф документации,
  накопившийся с приходом AliExpress и Циана: дерево пакетов в
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, счётчики навыков (15), источников (14), артефактов
  релиза (32) и мест хранения версии (84) в README, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
  `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `release.yml` и dsh-бандле.
- Офлайн-счётчик тестов в документации обновлён до 1349: двадцать четыре
  теста login-стены и анти-бот-вердикта Taobao добавились к 1325.

### Changed

- Documented offline test count is 1315: four dependency-parity tests on top
  of 1311. The documentation drift that had accumulated since AliExpress and
  Cian landed is swept in the same pass: the package tree in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, skill (15), source-server (14), release-artifact
  (32) and version-location (84) counts across README, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
  `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `release.yml` and the dsh bundle.
- Documented offline test count is 1349: twenty-four Taobao login-wall and
  anti-bot-verdict tests on top of 1325.

### Исправлено

- Классификация login-стены Taobao: стена с **пустым** `<title>` (живой замер
  2026-09-10 — именно так она сейчас и выглядит) раньше доходила до вердикта
  `drift_detected`, хотя по тристейт-доктрине сессия/IP/капча — это
  `inconclusive`, а не дрейф парсера. Детектор дополнен структурными
  маркерами: login-маршруты (`member/login.jhtml`, `register.jhtml`), общее
  число анкоров (порог `< 40`; здоровая страница несёт 133), видимый текст
  тела (`/登录|log ?in|sign ?in/i`). Решает Python, экстрактор-JS только
  передаёт счётчики и сниппет. Тулы отвечают `transport_down` с инструкцией
  про вход инлайн, `taobao_selfcheck` — `inconclusive` с причиной
  `login_wall`. Регрессионная фикстура — настоящий снимок стены (trimmed,
  с provenance и тестом на отсутствие сессионных данных).
- Вердикт капчи Taobao переехал из экстрактор-JS в Python и гейтится на
  пустой выдаче: скрытый текст виджета baxia («人机») раньше давал
  `__BLOCKED__` даже на здоровых страницах с 29–38 товарами, из-за чего
  shape-drift канарейка никогда не запускалась по-настоящему. Теперь страница
  с товарами не заблокирована (канарейка работает), а страница без товаров
  с текстом капчи — `inconclusive(blocked)`; старый JS-маркер
  `__BLOCKED__` понимается для легаси-payload'ов.
- Карточка товара, в **названии** которого есть «登录»/«login», больше не
  принимается за login-стену: title-маркер на card-payload читает заголовок
  документа (`page_title`), а не имя товара.

### Fixed

- Taobao login-wall classification: a wall with an **empty** `<title>` (the
  shape observed live on 2026-09-10) used to reach the `drift_detected`
  verdict, although the tri-state doctrine classes a session wall as
  `inconclusive`, never drift. The detector gained structural markers —
  login routes (`member/login.jhtml`, `register.jhtml`), total anchor count
  (ceiling `< 40`; a healthy page carries 133) and the visible body text
  (`/登录|log ?in|sign ?in/i`). Python decides; the extractor JS only
  transports counts and a snippet. Tools answer `transport_down` with the
  log-in fix inline, `taobao_selfcheck` answers `inconclusive` with reason
  `login_wall`. The regression fixture is a real trimmed capture of the wall
  with provenance and a test asserting it carries no session data.
- Taobao's captcha verdict moved from the extractor JS into Python and is
  gated on a zero-item extraction: the hidden baxia widget text («人机») used
  to bake `__BLOCKED__` even into healthy pages rendering 29–38 items, so the
  shape-drift canary never actually ran. A page with items is now not blocked
  (the canary runs); a zero-item page carrying captcha text is
  `inconclusive(blocked)`; the legacy JS `__BLOCKED__` marker is still
  honored for replayed older-build payloads.
- A card whose product **name** contains «登录»/«login» is no longer
  mistaken for a login wall: on card payloads the title marker reads the
  document title (`page_title`), never the product name.

### Изменено

- Мегамаркет: чтение адресов профиля (`/profileService/address/list` —
  аккаунтная зона, запрос с `credentials: include` в вашем залогиненном
  Chrome) стало **opt-in**: `MEGAMARKET_USE_PROFILE_ADDRESS=1`. По умолчанию
  выключено — адрес резолвится через публичный suggest-эндпоинт из
  `MEGAMARKET_ADDRESS` (Москва), поиск работает как прежде, но без
  персонализации профиля. Использование профиля раскрывается в
  `_meta.warnings` (`address_source:profile` + `profile_address_read`);
  сырой `addressId` не покидает процесс ни в успешных ответах, ни в ошибках
  (отказ при нуле офферов называет `address_source`, а не идентификатор).
  Раньше профильный эндпоинт читался безусловно при каждом старте.
- Офлайн-счётчик тестов в документации обновлён до 1356: семь тестов
  приватности Мегамаркета добавились к 1349.

### Исправлено

- `SECURITY.md` (RU+EN) и trust-boundary абзац README (обе половины) больше
  не утверждают, что MPStats — единственная точка входа в аккаунтную зону:
  список адресов профиля Мегамаркета документирован как вторая такая
  поверхность, доступная только через явный opt-in. Раньше пользователь мог
  включить Мегамаркет, полагая, что читаются лишь публичные каталожные
  эндпоинты, а сервер читал локационные данные профиля и персонализировал
  ими выдачу (находка S4 исследования `work/v2-research/security.md`).

### Changed

- Megamarket: reading the profile addresses (`/profileService/address/list` —
  an account-gated zone, fetched with `credentials: include` inside your
  logged-in Chrome) is now **opt-in**: `MEGAMARKET_USE_PROFILE_ADDRESS=1`.
  The default is off — the address resolves through the public suggest
  endpoint from `MEGAMARKET_ADDRESS` (Moscow), so search keeps working
  without profile personalization. Profile use is disclosed in
  `_meta.warnings` (`address_source:profile` + `profile_address_read`); the
  raw `addressId` never leaves the process, in successful responses or in
  errors alike (the zero-offers refusal names the `address_source`, not the
  identifier). Previously the profile endpoint was read unconditionally at
  startup.
- Documented offline test count is 1356: seven Megamarket privacy tests on
  top of 1349.

### Fixed

- `SECURITY.md` (RU+EN) and the README trust-boundary paragraph (both
  halves) no longer claim MPStats is the only account-gated surface: the
  Megamarket profile address list is now documented as a second such
  surface, reachable only through explicit opt-in. Previously a user could
  enable Megamarket believing only public catalog endpoints were read,
  while the server read profile location data and personalized results with
  it (finding S4 of `work/v2-research/security.md`).

### Исправлено

- `yandex_search` возвращал зачёркнутую базовую цену вместо той, что
  покупатель реально платит: `price_rub` строился из `offer.price.value`
  SERP-состояния (а на скидочных строках там лежит `initialPrice`) с
  фолбэком на тот же `initialPrice`. Живой замер 2026-09-11: Tuvio
  TKP2117S — коннектор отдавал 3698 ₽ при фактических 2367 ₽ (завышение
  +61%). Теперь `price_rub` берётся из корзины SERP
  (`productPayload.cartButton.price.valueFmt`), затем из
  `additionalPrices[withDiscount]`, и лишь в последнюю очередь из цены
  оффера; `price_with_plus` — из `actualPrice`/`yaBank`; `price_old_rub` —
  только когда зачёркнутая цена строго больше фактической. Побочный эффект
  на `compare_prices`: раньше яндекс-строки ранжировались по зачёркнутой
  цене и систематически проигрывали (завышение +24…+61%), из-за чего
  «cheapest» мог доставаться другому маркетплейсу при фактически более
  дешёвом Яндексе.
- Провенанс июльских фикстур yandex-поиска записывал «displayed» цены с
  выхода багованного парсера, а не с экрана (washer: записано 22600,
  страница показывала 16724) — value-pinning тесты фактически пиннили баг.
  Значения перечитаны из тех же снимков (HTML и sha256 не менялись),
  provenance-заметка исправлена с явной пометкой о коррекции. Добавлена
  новая живая фикстура `search_kettle` (снимок 2026-09-11) с тремя
  строками: регрессия зачёркнутой цены, промежуточная цена продавца,
  SERP-офер ≠ дефолт карточки.
- Задокументирован quirk Яндекса (сайт, не коннектор): строка SERP описывает
  офер сниппета, который может отличаться от дефолтного офера карточки
  (REDMOND: KM243 sku 4668084807 @2004 в выдаче против KM245 sku
  103808288420 @4146 на карточке того же pid). Строки поиска сверяются по
  `sku_id`, а не по product-URL; docstring, SKILL.md (×2) и README (RU+EN)
  это отражают.

### Изменено

- Офлайн-счётчик тестов в документации обновлён до 1360: четыре теста
  ценового маппинга yandex-поиска добавились к 1356.

### Fixed

- `yandex_search` returned the strike-through base price instead of what a
  buyer actually pays: `price_rub` was built from the SERP state's
  `offer.price.value` (which carries `initialPrice` on discounted rows) with
  a fallback to `initialPrice` itself. Measured live 2026-09-11: Tuvio
  TKP2117S — the connector said 3698 ₽ while the real price was 2367 ₽ (a
  +61 % overstatement). `price_rub` now comes from the SERP cart price
  (`productPayload.cartButton.price.valueFmt`), then
  `additionalPrices[withDiscount]`, and only then the offer price;
  `price_with_plus` from `actualPrice`/`yaBank`; `price_old_rub` only when
  the strike-through price is strictly greater. Side effect on
  `compare_prices`: Yandex rows used to rank by the strike-through price and
  lost systematically (+24…+61 % inflation), so "cheapest" could go to
  another marketplace while Yandex was actually cheaper.
- The July search fixtures' provenance recorded "displayed" prices from the
  buggy parser's output rather than the screen (washer: recorded 22600, the
  page showed 16724) — the value-pinning tests were pinning the bug. Values
  re-read from the same captures (HTML and sha256 unchanged), the provenance
  note corrected with an explicit annotation. New live fixture
  `search_kettle` (captured 2026-09-11) covers three rows: the
  strike-through regression, an intermediate seller price, and a SERP offer
  differing from the card default.
- Documented a Yandex site-side quirk (not a connector bug): a SERP row
  describes the snippet's offer, which can differ from the card's default
  offer (REDMOND: KM243 sku 4668084807 @2004 in search vs KM245 sku
  103808288420 @4146 on the card for the same pid). Search rows verify
  against `sku_id`, not the product URL; docstring, SKILL.md (×2) and README
  (RU+EN) now say so.

### Changed

- Documented offline test count is 1360: four yandex-search price-mapping
  tests on top of 1356.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- Средний DSH-профиль `ru-marketplace-decision` (консоль-скрипт `decision-mcp`):
  сравнение цен плюс один card inspector `decision_inspect(source, product_id_or_url)`.
  Позволяет проверить победителя сравнения, продавца и карточку без полного
  37-инструментного mount; ряд включён в `dsh/cordis.patch.yml` выключенным по
  умолчанию и включается через `RU_MARKETPLACE_MCP_DECISION=1` (взаимоисключающе
  с полным mount).
- `compare_prices`: предложения теперь несут `identity` (бренд, модель, MPN,
  GTIN, атрибуты варианта) и `evidence` (provenance нативного оффера), чтобы
  точное соответствие товара проверялось, а не предполагалось.
- Reliability-скрипты: детерминированный routing-контракт DSH
  (`scripts/routing_eval.py`), операционные гейты (`scripts/test_ops_gates.py`),
  baseline/snapshot-режимы `scripts/mcp_wire.py` против регрессии wire-токенов
  и латентности.
- CDP: ограничение размера websocket-фреймов и allowlist финального хоста
  (`_check_final_host`) после навигации.

### Изменено

- `e2e_stdio_check.py` проверяет 15 stdio-серверов, включая `decision-mcp`;
  dsh-bundle guard в CI ожидает 3 MCP rows, все выключены по умолчанию.
- Офлайн-счётчик тестов в документации обновлён до 1243.

### Added

- Middle DSH profile `ru-marketplace-decision` (`decision-mcp`): comparison plus
  one card inspector `decision_inspect(source, product_id_or_url)`, shipped
  disabled by default and enabled with `RU_MARKETPLACE_MCP_DECISION=1`.
- `compare_prices` offers carry `identity` (brand, model, MPN, GTIN, variant
  attributes) and `evidence` provenance for verifiable exact-product matching.
- Reliability scripts: DSH routing eval, operational gates, and
  `mcp_wire.py` wire-token/latency regression baselines.
- CDP hardening: bounded websocket frames and a final-host allowlist.

### Changed

- `e2e_stdio_check.py` covers 15 stdio servers including `decision-mcp`; the DSH
  bundle CI guard asserts all 3 MCP rows are disabled by default.
- Documented offline test count is 1243.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-09-09

### Исправлено

- macOS: CDP-Chrome больше не забирает фокус и не перекидывает рабочий стол
  (Space) на каждый вызов. Причина была в `Target.createTarget` без
  `background: true` — так Chrome становится активным приложением, а macOS
  следует за его окном; закрытие вкладки и навигация вдобавок «расхайдивали»
  приложение. Режим `CHROME_STEALTH` (по умолчанию включён) теперь работает и на
  macOS: вкладки открываются в фоне в обоих путях (Playwright через
  browser-level CDP-сессию и raw CDP), а окно скрапинг-профиля прячется (⌘H)
  после навигации и после закрытия вкладки. `start_chrome_cdp.sh` прячет окно
  сразу после подъёма CDP. Прячется только процесс с нашим `--user-data-dir`;
  основной Chrome не трогается. `CHROME_STEALTH=0` возвращает прежнее поведение.

### Fixed

- macOS: the CDP Chrome no longer steals focus or drags the desktop to its
  Space on every call. `Target.createTarget` without `background: true` makes
  Chrome the active app and macOS follows its window; closing the tab and
  navigating un-hid the app on top of that. `CHROME_STEALTH` (on by default) now
  covers macOS: tabs open in the background on both paths (Playwright via a
  browser-level CDP session, and raw CDP), and the scraping-profile window is
  hidden (⌘H) after navigation and after the tab closes. `start_chrome_cdp.sh`
  hides the window as soon as CDP is up. Only the process running our
  `--user-data-dir` is touched; the operator's daily Chrome is left alone.
  `CHROME_STEALTH=0` restores the old behaviour.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-09-09

### Исправлено

- Docker stdio release probe обновлён до 37 tools после добавления
  `compare_verify_offer`; MCP Registry publish снова проверяет фактическую
  unified surface.

### Fixed

- Docker stdio release probe now expects 37 tools after adding
  `compare_verify_offer`, so MCP Registry publication verifies the actual
  unified surface.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- Продуктовый trust/evidence слой: comparable winner, stock-aware ranking,
  native card verification и capability metadata для routing.
- DSH progressive disclosure и activation contract.
- v2 research artifacts, eval matrix и security findings.
- Исправлена утечка upstream MPStats message в MCP ToolError.

### Added

- Product trust/evidence layer: comparable winner, stock-aware ranking, native
  card verification, and routing capability metadata.
- DSH progressive disclosure and activation contract.
- v2 research artifacts, eval matrix, and security findings.
- Fixed upstream MPStats message leakage into MCP ToolError.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- Lightweight `compare_verify_offer` проверяет победившее предложение через
  native card tool без включения full unified mount.

### Added

- Lightweight `compare_verify_offer` verifies a winning offer through its native
  card tool without enabling the full unified mount.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- `compare_prices(in_stock_only=true)` ранжирует только предложения с явно
  подтверждённым наличием, сохраняя исключённые строки для аудита.

### Added

- `compare_prices(in_stock_only=true)` ranks only offers with explicitly
  confirmed stock while retaining excluded rows for auditability.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- `compare_prices` возвращает `cheapest_comparable` — более безопасного кандидата
  после исключения очевидных аксессуаров и товаров в другом состоянии.
- `marketplace_sources` публикует статические capability-метаданные для routing:
  access tier, CDP/login, валюту, text search и mounted state.
- DSH skills разделяют cheap compare routing и full marketplace activation.

### Added

- `compare_prices` exposes `cheapest_comparable`, a safer candidate after
  excluding obvious accessories and different-condition listings.
- `marketplace_sources` exposes static routing capabilities: access tier,
  CDP/login, currency, text-search support, and mounted state.
- DSH skills separate cheap compare routing from full marketplace activation.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-09-09

### Добавлено

- `ozon_reviews` помечает каждый отзыв полем `item_id` — SKU товара, о котором отзыв
  написан на самом деле. Ozon держит один пул отзывов на всю карточку-семейство, и
  соседи по пулу регулярно оказываются другим товаром другого бренда: у карточки
  Huter 1500 Вт (SKU 5264146973, 4.8 из 356 отзывов) среди 100 вытянутых отзывов не
  было ни одного о самом Huter. Без `item_id` агент выдавал чужой рейтинг за
  собственный.
- Ответ `ozon_reviews` дополнен полями `requested_item_id`, `own_reviews` (сколько
  возвращённых отзывов относится к запрошенному SKU) и `pool_variants`
  (`SKU → название` всех товаров пула), чтобы чужой `item_id` можно было назвать.

### Added

- `ozon_reviews` tags every review with `item_id`, the SKU the review is actually
  about. Ozon serves one review pool per card family and the neighbours are often a
  different product from a different brand: a card for a 1500 W Huter (SKU
  5264146973, 4.8 across 356 reviews) returned 100 reviews, none of them about the
  Huter. Without `item_id` an agent reports a borrowed rating as the product's own.
- The `ozon_reviews` response gained `requested_item_id`, `own_reviews` (how many
  returned reviews belong to the requested SKU) and `pool_variants` (`SKU → name` for
  every product in the pool), so a foreign `item_id` can be named.

### Исправлено

- **Avito снова честный selfcheck** (спасибо @avxone за находку): Avito перенёс
  массив объявлений из верхнего уровня payload в `catalog.items[]`. Парсер уже
  читал новую форму, а смоук-проверка ждала старую и отвечала `drift_detected` на
  живом поиске. Семейства ключей принимают оба конверта, фикстура и справочник
  формы ре-фингерпринтированы по живому замеру 2026-08-29.
- CDP-поиск Taobao и Lamoda теперь отличает антибот-проверку с HTTP 200 от
  настоящего parser drift и возвращает честный `inconclusive/blocked`.
- Все пакеты ограничили FastMCP диапазоном `>=3.4.6,<4`: FastMCP 4 меняет
  публичную MCP-схему `_meta` на `meta` и несовместим с текущим контрактом.

### Fixed

- **Avito selfcheck honest again** (thanks @avxone): Avito moved the listings array
  from the payload's top level into `catalog.items[]`. The parser already followed
  it, but the smoke check waited for the old shape and answered `drift_detected`
  on live traffic. Required key families now accept both envelopes; fixture and
  shape reference re-fingerprinted from a live capture dated 2026-08-29.
- CDP search for Taobao and Lamoda now distinguishes an HTTP 200 anti-bot
  challenge from real parser drift and reports `inconclusive/blocked` honestly.
- All packages cap FastMCP at `>=3.4.6,<4`: FastMCP 4 changes the public MCP
  schema from `_meta` to `meta` and is incompatible with the current contract.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-20

### Добавлено

- **Коннектор AliExpress** (`aliexpress_search`, `aliexpress_card`) — одиннадцатый
  источник и пятый CDP-only. У AliExpress нет анонимного пути: x5sec ставит капчу
  на карточки, а поиск отдаёт пустую SPA-оболочку (замерено 2026-08-20,
  `docs/ANTI_BOT.md`). Коннектор садится на страницу поиска, которую не
  челленджат, и открывает карточку новой вкладкой из неё. Цены в рублях,
  участвуют в `compare_prices`.
- Честное состояние `price_missing`: под нагрузкой x5sec тихо убирает ценовой
  модуль у карточек — коннектор сообщает об этом предупреждением, а не числом.
- Тексты отзывов намеренно не отдаются (вкладка отзывов за капчей); рейтинг и
  число заказов читаются из карточки и из меты.
- Скилл `skills/aliexpress-connector/SKILL.md` (и в вендоре `dsh/`), domtest-фикстуры
  живой выдачи и карточки, tri-state selfcheck с цепочкой поиск→карточка.

### Изменено

- Объединённый сервер теперь монтирует 35 инструментов (36 с `marketplace_sources`);
  `scripts/e2e_stdio_check.py`, CI-таблицы ожидаемых инструментов и dsh-витрина
  обновлены соответственно.
- Вендор `dsh/` несёт 14 скиллов.
- `docs/CDP_SETUP.md`: восемь источников через браузер; CDP-only теперь пять.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-16

Патч доставки для официального MCP-реестра: OCI-образ stdio, настоящий
`docker run -i` probe в CI и публикация `server.json` через `mcp-publisher` на
каждый тег. Функциональных изменений поверхности нет.

### Добавлено

- `Dockerfile.stdio` с `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`, `CMD ["marketplace-mcp"]` и
  OCI-меткой владения для MCP Registry.
- `scripts/e2e_stdio_check_docker.py` — initialize / tools/list / tools/call
  через настоящий `docker run --rm -i`.
- `.github/workflows/mcp-registry-publish.yml` — на тег `v*`: сборка и push в
  GHCR, docker-stdio probe, `mcp-publisher login github-oidc` + `publish`.
- `packages` в `server.json`: `ghcr.io/vladimir-human/ru-marketplace-mcp:1.5.1`,
  `runtimeHint: docker`, transport stdio.

### Изменено

- Версия всех 72 объявлений поднята на 1.5.1.

English summary:

### Added

- `Dockerfile.stdio` with `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`, a default
  `marketplace-mcp` entrypoint and the MCP Registry ownership label.
- `scripts/e2e_stdio_check_docker.py`: a real initialize / tools/list /
  tools/call session over `docker run --rm -i`.
- A tag-driven workflow that pushes the OCI image to GHCR, runs the docker
  stdio probe, then authenticates through GitHub OIDC and publishes
  `server.json` with `mcp-publisher`.
- An `oci` package entry in `server.json` pointing at the 1.5.1 GHCR image.

### Changed

- All 72 version declarations bumped to 1.5.1.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-16

Основной релиз: установка в DeepSeek Harness и снижение постоянной цены
MCP-контекста втрое. Теперь есть бандл `dsh/` (13 скиллов сразу, две
MCP-строки выключены до явного включения), `marketplace-mcp install dsh`,
гейты бандла в тестах и CI.

### Изменено

- **Выходные схемы сжаты до имён полей верхнего уровня.** По реальному
  MCP-проводу: `marketplace-mcp` — 38 078 → 13 020 токенов на запрос,
  `compare-mcp` — 2 424 → 918. Доля выходных схем упала с 64 % до 10 %.
- **11 `*_selfcheck` ушли с MCP-поверхности** и остались CLI-only:
  `marketplace-mcp doctor` их по-прежнему вызывает. Модельный набор — 33
  инструмента в двенадцати серверах и 34 в объединённом вместо 44/45.
- **Скиллы больше не предлагают агенту вызвать selfcheck.** Проверка паритета
  теперь про раздел: пункт под заголовком «Tools available» обязан быть
  зарегистрированным MCP-инструментом.
- **Описания скиллов `mpstats-connector` и `compare-prices`** приведены под
  лимит каталога dsh (476 и 449 символов).

### Добавлено

- **Бандл `dsh/`** и разделы про dsh в корневом README на обоих языках.
- **Гейт установки бандла в CI** (`dsh-bundle`): состав профиля, 13 скиллов,
  обе MCP-строки `disabled`, откат через `remove`.
- **`mcp_wire.py` / `mcp_startup.py`** — замеры цены и старта MCP-серверов по
  настоящему протоколу.

### Исправлено

- `dsh/package.json` выпадал из git из-за общего ignore `package.json`
  (CI checkout был без манифеста бандла); добавлено исключение.
- Smoke-работа CI и `e2e_stdio_check.py` ожидали прежние счётчики
  инструментов (вплоть до 45); приведены к новой поверхности.

English summary:

### Changed

- Output schemas now advertise top-level field names only. Measured over a real
  stdio session: `marketplace-mcp` fell from ~38,078 to ~13,020 tokens per
  request, `compare-mcp` from ~2,424 to ~918. Output-schema cost share: 64% → 10%.
- The 11 operator `*_selfcheck` diagnostics left the MCP surface and remain
  CLI-only via `marketplace-mcp doctor`. The model-facing surface is now 33
  tools across twelve servers and 34 in the unified server, instead of 44/45.
- Skills no longer list selfchecks under "Tools available"; the parity gate now
  checks that a tools-list entry names a registered MCP tool.

### Added

- A DeepSeek Harness bundle in `dsh/` with 13 skills and two disabled
  MCP rows; root README sections in Russian and English.
- A CI job that installs the bundle into a clean profile and asserts the profile
  layer, 13 skills, both MCP rows disabled, and clean removal.
- `scripts/mcp_wire.py` and `scripts/mcp_startup.py` for wire-level cost and
  startup measurements.

### Fixed

- `dsh/package.json` was silently ignored by the root `package.json` gitignore
  rule, so CI checkouts shipped without the bundle manifest; an exception now
  tracks it.
- CI smoke and `e2e_stdio_check.py` still expected the old tool counts (up to
  45); they now match the new surface.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-08

Патч по итогам четырёх независимых аудитов, проведённых сразу после v1.4.0.
Две находки закрыты; контракт инструментов и гейт не менялись.

### Исправлено

- **`coerce_int` и его дубль `compare._as_count` больше не фабрикуют счётчики
  из юникодных знаков и range-строк.** Гард знаков покрывал только ASCII
  `[-+]`, поэтому юникодный минус (U+2212) и тире (U+2013/U+2014), которыми
  маркетплейсы рендерят диапазоны, проходили насквозь: «1 000–2 000»
  конкатенировалось в 10002000, «−5» читалось как 5. Теперь и то и другое —
  `None` (fail loud), в паритете с `coerce_price`. Целочисленные и float-входы
  не тронуты — property-тест pass-through целых остался зелёным. Обнаружено
  независимым аудитом доктрины, 5 красных тестов до фикса.

### Добавлено

- **Провенансы для 7 живых фикстур**, у которых их не было (citilink
  `search_grid`, avito `js_items_live`, 5 фикстур yandex). Закрыто нарушение
  правила «фикстура без `.provenance.json` считается выдуманной»; теперь каждая
  живая фикстура имеет url/дату/sha256/метод съёма/ground truth.

English summary:

### Fixed

- `coerce_int` and its `compare._as_count` duplicate no longer fabricate counts
  from unicode signs and ranges. The sign guard only covered ASCII `[-+]`, so a
  unicode minus (U+2212) or dash (U+2013/U+2014) slipped through —
  «1 000–2 000» concatenated to 10002000, «−5» read as 5. Both now return
  `None` (fail loud), matching `coerce_price`. Integer/float inputs are
  unchanged (the integer pass-through property test stays green). Found by an
  independent doctrine audit; 5 red tests before the fix.

### Added

- Provenance files for 7 live fixtures that lacked them (citilink
  `search_grid`, avito `js_items_live`, 5 yandex fixtures). No live fixture is
  left without url/date/sha256/capture-method/ground-truth provenance.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-08

Релиз паритета доктрины и живых доказательств. Полтора десятка локальных
парсеров цен и счётчиков приведены к одной гарантии — «никогда 0, никогда
отрицательная, никогда не-конечная, никогда не бросает» — и зафиксированы
тестами на байтах, реально снятых с маркетплейсов. Плюс транспорт теперь
переживает Chrome новее, чем понимает Playwright. Контракт инструментов не
менялся; все изменения — в устойчивости чтений и в честности вердиктов.

### Исправлено

- **Каждый локальный парсер цены/счётчика закрыт от не-цен.** `compare._as_price`
  (отрицательные, inf, OverflowError), `compare._as_count` (NaN/Infinity,
  тихий сброс знака «-3» → 3), `yandex.ssr._to_number/_to_int` (inf и
  OverflowError огромных чисел), `wb._kopeck_to_rub` (inf и OverflowError на
  гигантских копейках), `avito._posted_at` (OverflowError огромного
  timestamp'а), `mcp_core.coerce_rating` и `parse_retry_after` (OverflowError,
  inf/nan). Одна отравленная ячейка больше не обрывает вызов инструмента.
- **`compare._as_price` делегирован в `mcp_core.coerce_price`.** Дублирующая
  реализация фабрикующе склеивала range-строки («1 000–2 000 ₽» → 10 002 000).
  Перевод доказан живьём: 144 ценовые строки, снятые с поиска и карточки Ozon,
  парсятся обеими реализациями одинаково, кроме range-строк, где дубликат
  фабриковал, а общий парсер честно отказывает.
- **Три живых дрейфа карточного экстрактора Taobao**, пойманные съёмом живой
  карточки: заголовок читал плейсхолдер «按图片搜索» (на современной странице
  нет h1, имя — в mainTitle-спане), цена не находилась вовсе (современная
  раскладка рендерит её спанами symbol/text внутри highlightPrice/subPrice, а
  не одним глиф-узлом), shop/sales склеивали текст всей страницы. Экстрактор
  читает и старую, и новую раскладку; обе зафиксированы фикстурами.
- **Два дрейфа поискового экстрактора Lamoda**, пойманные живым съёмом: бейдж
  скидки «−49%» внутри image-anchor'а читался как заголовок, а конкатенированные
  размеры плитки уходили в зачёркнутую цену (3.5e16 ₽). Заголовок теперь берётся
  из product-name-узла, ценовой hunt скоуплен в ценовой блок.
- **Разрыв цен WB search-vs-card переизмерен живьём** и описан честно: на пяти
  товарах 1.7–34.3 %, направление не униформно по товарам, поисковая цена
  протухает (не менялась 10 дней при движении карточной). Правило «цитируй
  `wb_card`, сверяй до победителя» встроено в скилл; ранжирование не тронуто.

### Добавлено

- **Raw-CDP fallback в `mcp-core`.** Chrome 151 перестал отвечать на
  connect_over_cdp-рукопожатие Playwright (проверено на Playwright 1.61 и 1.62:
  websocket соединяется, attach висит; сырые CDP-команды по тому же сокету
  отвечают). Транспорт при таймауте attach'а ведёт вкладку по сырому протоколу:
  scheme-guard, NavBlocked-вердикты по статусу главного документа и
  evaluate-семантика Playwright сохранены. На старых Chrome ничего не меняется —
  Playwright-путь байт-в-байт прежний. Это вернуло к работе все CDP-источники
  на свежем Chrome: `doctor` показывает 6 healthy вместо 3.
- **Живые фикстуры с провенансом** (sha256 LF-байтов, метод съёма, ground
  truth): поиск Ozon (composer JSON, снят из прогретой сессии — в лоб
  composer-API отвечает 403 анти-фрода), карточка Taobao, поиск Lamoda, поиск и
  карточка WB (v9/card v4), карточка и категория Детского Мира, поиск
  Мегамаркета. Парсеры исполняются на этих байтах в офлайн-тестах.
- **Сверка живой сигнатуры в selfcheck Lamoda и Taobao** (shape_reference):
  selfcheck сравнивает форму живого ответа с эталоном, снятым с этих фикстур, и
  именует пропавшие семейства ключей. Все четыре CDP-источника с DOM-поиском
  теперь под сверкой.
- **Секции `## Return Format` и `## Error Format` у всех 45 инструментов.**
  Выяснилось, что griffe обрезает описание инструмента после `Args:` — секции,
  стоявшие ниже, не попадали в живой маунт. Секции перенесены перед `Args:`;
  структурный тест пинит наличие обеих секций у каждого смонтированного
  инструмента.
- `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.4.0.md` с таблицей, какие источники проверены живо и как,
  а какие не проверены и почему.

### Прочее

- Офлайн-тесты: 980 → 1146 (+166). Покрытие ветвей 78.83 % (порог 70 %).
- Версия согласована в 72 местах (`check_versions.py`), счётчик тестов в 7
  местах сверяет `check_test_count.py`, e2e_stdio_check — 13/13 серверов.
- Живой `doctor` на момент выпуска: wildberries, ozon, yandex, detmir, taobao,
  citilink — healthy; avito (анти-бот), dns (401 сессии), megamarket
  (ServicePipe), mpstats (нет платного токена) — честные inconclusive.
- Бюджет живых запросов прогона: 25 из 40 (см. журнал живого прогона).

English summary:

### Fixed

- Every local price/count parser is closed against non-prices: compare
  `_as_price`/`_as_count`, yandex `_to_number`/`_to_int`, wb `_kopeck_to_rub`,
  avito `_posted_at`, mcp-core `coerce_rating`/`parse_retry_after` — negatives,
  inf/NaN, OverflowError. One poisoned cell no longer aborts a tool call.
- compare's `_as_price` now delegates to `mcp_core.coerce_price`; the duplicate
  fabricated prices out of range strings (proved on 144 live Ozon strings).
- Three live drifts in the Taobao card extractor and two in the Lamoda search
  extractor, caught by capturing the live pages; both layouts stay supported.
- The WB search-vs-card gap re-measured live (1.7–34.3 %, direction not uniform,
  search index goes stale); the skill now says quote `wb_card`.

### Added

- Raw-CDP fallback in mcp-core: Chrome 151 no longer answers Playwright's
  connect_over_cdp handshake, so the transport drives the tab over raw CDP when
  the attach times out. Restores every CDP source on modern Chrome (doctor: 6
  healthy instead of 3); behaviour on older Chrome is unchanged.
- Live fixtures with provenance (sha256, capture method, ground truth) for Ozon
  search, Taobao card, Lamoda search, WB search/card, Detsky Mir card/category,
  Megamarket search; parsers run on those bytes offline.
- Live shape-signature checks in the Lamoda and Taobao selfchecks.
- `## Return Format` / `## Error Format` on all 45 tools (moved before `Args:`
  because griffe truncates descriptions after it), pinned by a structural test.
- `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.4.0.md` with the verified/unverified source table.

### Other

- Offline tests 980 → 1146 (+166); branch coverage 78.83 % (floor 70 %).
- Version agreed in 72 places; live doctor: 6 healthy, 4 honestly inconclusive
  (avito anti-bot, dns 401, megamarket ServicePipe, mpstats needs a paid token).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-08-04

Hardening-правки по итогам независимого аудита. Поведение инструментов не
менялось: имена, аргументы и формы ответов те же, что в v1.3.0.

### Исправлено

- Экстракторы DOM декодируют вывод как явный UTF-8: без этого фрагмент с
  кириллицей мог быть прочитан в cp1251, а тест-раннер jsdom терял
  не-ASCII-символы в фикстурах.
- Глифы валют генерируются из одного списка, а не из трёх разъехавшихся
  регулярных выражений; юани признаются наравне с рублём.
- DNS: признак наличия на карточке берётся из `textContent`, а не из
  сломанного соседнего элемента.
- Taobao: оба экстрактора переведены на общие DOM-хелперы из `mcp-core`.
- Тесты экстракторов закреплены за снятыми фикстурами: Lamoda (поиск),
  Citilink (карточка), Taobao (поиск и карточка), DNS (карточка). Раньше
  поведение проверялось только на живой странице, которая может дрейфовать.

### Добавлено

- DOM-фикстуры и тесты для карточек DNS и Citilink и для поиска Taobao и
  Lamoda — десять новых тестов.

### Прочее

- Число офлайн-тестов в документации приведено к измеренному: 980.

English summary:

### Fixed

- DOM extractors decode output as explicit UTF-8.
- Currency glyph regexes are generated from one list; yuan is admitted.
- DNS card availability falls back to `textContent`.
- Taobao's extractors share the `mcp-core` DOM helpers.
- Extractor behaviour is pinned to captured fixtures (Lamoda search,
  Citilink card, Taobao search and card, DNS card).

### Added

- DOM fixtures and extractor tests for DNS/Citilink cards and Taobao/Lamoda
  search — ten new tests.

### Other

- The documented offline test count is the measured 980.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-30

Новый коннектор MPStats, первый платный источник в проекте. До этого все серверы
читали анонимные scrape-эндпоинты без ключей, а MPStats устроен качественно
иначе: это аналитический слой поверх Ozon и Wildberries, с квотой и аккаунтом. Он
опционален: без `MPSTATS_MP_AUTH` сервер запускается, инструменты отвечают
`auth_missing`, а остальные двенадцать серверов работают как прежде.

Первоначальный код коннектора прислал [@Xpos587](https://github.com/Xpos587) в
[PR #5](https://github.com/Vladimir-Human/ru-marketplace-mcp/pull/5). Здесь он
переработан под инварианты, которых держится остальной проект, но идея, разбор
API плагина и структура парсеров — его.

### Добавлено

**Новый сервер `mpstats-mcp` (3 инструмента)**
- `mpstats_item(skus, place, oz_fbs=True)` — аналитика продаж/цены/остатков за 30
  дней по до 100 SKU Ozon или Wildberries: 4 графика по дням (заказы, цены,
  остатки, рубрики), текущая цена и остаток (последняя ненулевая ячейка графика),
  продавец/бренд, агрегаты `totals` (orders/sum/sum_prev), скользящий
  `orders_per_day`.
- `mpstats_warehouses(skus, place)` — остатки по складам: FBS (склад продавца) и
  FBO (склад маркетплейса), плюс `last_update` апстрима.
- `mpstats_selfcheck()` — канарейка в трёх состояниях: `success` /
  `drift_detected` / `inconclusive`. Отсутствие токена и транспортные сбои
  попадают в `inconclusive`, а не в `drift`, чтобы не гнать мейнтейнера искать
  дрейф схемы, которого не было.

**Авторизация.** Эндпоинт `POST plugin.mpstats.io/pluginapi` работает в стиле
RPC: метод лежит в поле `Request`, параметры называются `Sku`, `Place`, `ozFBS`.
Авторизует одна cookie `mp_auth`, то есть JWT из залогиненной сессии плагина на
mpstats.io, и задаётся она через `MPSTATS_MP_AUTH`. По данным автора холодный
replay с одним только `mp_auth` отвечает 200 с данными, а без него приходит тело
`{"code":403,"message":"Unauthorized"}` под HTTP 200. Этот внутренний код мапится
в `auth_missing`, чтобы отказ авторизации не читался как «нет данных». Токен
остаётся секретом платного аккаунта с квотой: он не логируется и не коммитится.

**Транспорт.** Первый ярус на httpx, но только POST, а `get_text_budgeted` из
`mcp-core` умеет исключительно GET. Поэтому в коннекторе живёт локальный помощник
`_post_json_budgeted` с теми же инвариантами: байтовый кап, бюджет по времени,
классифицированные ошибки, ретраи только транспортных сбоев, вежливый гейт между
попытками. POST-путь в общий рантайм не добавлен намеренно. Он нужен одному
коннектору, а перенос в ядро расширил бы тестовую поверхность для всех
тринадцати.

**Парсеры.** Графики длиной `days` (по умолчанию 30), от старых к новым: последняя
ненулевая ячейка — текущая цена/остаток, снятое с продажи SKU даёт `None`, не
ложный `0`, который выиграл бы сравнение «где дешевле». Остаток при сплошь
нулевом графике ведёт себя наоборот и становится `0`, потому что «нет на складе»
это показание, а не отсутствие данных. Пустой график даёт `None` в обоих случаях.
Ноль в отдельной ячейке значит «нет данных за тот день», а не «значение было
нулевым». `coerce_int` и `coerce_price` отказываются угадывать неоднозначные
формы, будь то знак или диапазон цен: лучше `None`, чем правдоподобное и неверное
число. 52 офлайн-теста
покрывают парсеры, контракт ошибок, auth-гейт, три-стейт selfcheck и транспорт
`_post_json_budgeted` (байтовый кап, wall-clock бюджет, ретраи только транспортных
сбоев, классификация ошибок).

**Прочее.** `mpstats-mcp` смонтирован в объединённый `marketplace-mcp` (стало 45
инструментов: 44 смонтированных плюс `marketplace_sources`), добавлен в `doctor`,
registry-запись в `server.json`, навык `skills/mpstats-connector`, README (RU+EN),
CI-счётчик инструментов.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-28

Патч по итогам стороннего ревью. Поведение инструментов не менялось; правки
касаются документации и одного пути к модулю в тестовом харнессе.

### Исправлено

- **Скидочный бейдж мог стать ценой.** `coerce_price` обещает в докстринге
  «NEVER a negative», но выполнял это только для чисел: строка `-500 ₽`
  разбиралась в 500, потому что токенайзер смотрел на цифры и не смотрел на
  знак перед ними. Маркетплейсы печатают такой бейдж рядом с настоящей ценой, а
  меньшее число выигрывает сравнение «где дешевле» — тот же класс, что рассрочка
  в поле цены. Теперь ведущий минус (в четырёх начертаниях) отбрасывает
  кандидата.
- **`NaN` и бесконечность роняли инструмент целиком.** `json.loads` принимает
  оба по умолчанию, а `int()` на них падает; у `coerce_price` проверка на
  конечность была, у `coerce_int` — нет. Одна испорченная ячейка обрывала весь
  вызов вместо того, чтобы обнулить одно поле.
- **Токен MPStats попадал в текст `ToolError`.** В лог ошибка писалась
  вычищенной, а в ответ инструмента — сырой; достаточно перевода строки в конце
  скопированного токена, чтобы httpx положил весь заголовок `Cookie` в текст
  исключения, а тот уходит модели и в транскрипт клиента. Остальные коннекторы
  вычищают это место; MPStats был единственным с секретом и единственным без
  вычистки. Заодно `mp_auth` стал `SecretStr`, так что `repr` и `model_dump`
  настроек больше не печатают его.
- **Отказ авторизации кешировался.** Запись в кеш шла по HTTP 200 до разбора
  внутреннего `code`, а MPStats отдаёт и `403`, и свои `5xx` под двухсотым
  статусом. Пользователь вставлял свежую cookie и продолжал получать
  `auth_missing`, пока не истечёт TTL. Кеш переехал за вердикт.
- **`uv run pre-commit install` из `CONTRIBUTING.md` не работал.** Хуки
  документированы как запускаемые через `uv run`, но самого `pre-commit` в
  dev-зависимостях не было: команда падала на чистом клоне и проходила только у
  того, у кого он стоял глобально. Добавлен в группу `dev`.
- **Комментарий в `resilience.py` ссылался на три коннектора, которых в проекте
  нет** (`youtube`, `fourpda`, `x`), и обосновывал устройство трёхсостоянийного
  selfcheck ссылкой на консультацию с языковой моделью. Первое — след чужого
  проекта, второе ничего не сообщает читателю. Обоснование там и без этого
  самодостаточное, ссылки убраны, названы девять коннекторов, которые контракт
  реально используют.
- **MPStats не замедлялся после отказа.** Восемь коннекторов ходят через общий
  `mcp_core.pacing.Pacer`, который после `429` или блокировки удлиняет паузу;
  MPStats был единственным со своим трёхстрочным гейтом и после отказа шёл в ту
  же стену с той же скоростью. Для источника, чья оферта делает превышение темпа
  основанием для блокировки аккаунта без возврата денег, это била по пользователю.
  Переведён на общий `Pacer`, отказы и успехи записываются.
- **Одна ошибка у Lamoda уходила невычищенной.** `TransportDownError` с текстом
  исключения без `_redact` — единственное такое место в проекте после правок
  MPStats.
- **Число офлайн-тестов в документации снова разошлось** — и дважды подряд по
  вине самого аудита, который его же и правил, потому что добавлял тесты. Цифра
  стоит в семи местах и правится руками, то есть портится по расписанию. Теперь
  её сверяет `scripts/check_test_count.py` (в гейте, в CI и в pre-commit),
  сравнивая с тем, что реально отбирает коллекция. Заодно выяснилось, что число
  было неоднозначным: тестов существует 946, а без необязательного jsdom
  проходит 937 и девять честно скипаются.
- **Пин `mcp-core` мог разойтись с версией и остаться незамеченным.** Внутри
  workspace `uv.sources` перекрывает ограничение, поэтому устаревший пин проходит
  и `uv lock`, и `uv sync`, и весь набор тестов — ударяет он только по тому, кто
  ставит колесо со страницы релиза. `check_versions.py` теперь сверяет и пин:
  мест стало 72 вместо 59.
- **Зависимость `mcp-core` не была запинена, а имя занято на PyPI** посторонним
  пакетом. Колесо, скачанное со страницы релиза и поставленное `pip`, тихо
  подтягивало чужой код, после чего сервер падал на импорте. Во всех тринадцати
  коннекторах стоит `mcp-core==1.2.1`: теперь это громкий отказ разрешения
  зависимостей вместо тихой подмены.
- **`classify_http_error` падал при любом вызове** — импортировал `mcp_common`,
  пакета с таким именем в проекте нет. Функция экспортирована из `mcp_core`, но
  ни разу не вызывалась, поэтому никто не замечал. Импорт исправлен на
  `mcp_core.errors`.
- **CI-шаг «Every server imports and registers its tools» проверял 11 серверов
  из 12.** `mpstats` был в списке ожиданий, но не в проверяемом словаре, и цикл
  его пропускал, печатая «all servers registered their expected tools». Теперь
  расхождение ключей — первая же ошибка шага.
- `check_versions.py` не замечал исчезнувшего объявления версии: удаление строки
  `__version__` просто уменьшало число в сводке. Теперь это провал.
- `pre-commit` был красным на чистом дереве: девяти файлам не хватало
  завершающего перевода строки. Двум исходникам он дописан, а снятые с сайтов
  фикстуры исключены из хука — это разметка-улика, править её нельзя.
- `scripts/start_chrome_cdp.sh` был закоммичен без бита исполнения, хотя
  документация просит запускать его напрямую.
- Заголовок `start_chrome_cdp.ps1` описывал несуществующий коннектор и советовал
  логиниться в x.com, а выделенный профиль называл «для параноиков» — при том
  что он и есть поведение по умолчанию.

### Исправлено в документации

- Число офлайн-тестов, счёт артефактов релиза (28, не 26), число тестов MPStats
  и замер покрытия приведены к измеренному.
- Проза про `*_PROXY` называла среди семи коннекторов Taobao, у которого этой
  настройки нет намеренно, и не называла MPStats, у которого она есть.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` и `docs/ADDING_A_SOURCE.md` советовали голый
  `uv run pytest -q`, который собирает живые тесты; в шаблоне PR остался глоб
  `packages/*/src`, не работающий в PowerShell.
- «CI прогоняет линтер, типы и все тесты на трёх ОС» — на трёх ОС идут только
  тесты, остальное один раз на Ubuntu.
- Навык Мегамаркета обещал данные пройденному челленджу; на деле нужен вход в
  аккаунт. Навык Ozon показывал `ozon_search(query)` и «top 20 results» вместо
  настоящей сигнатуры с `page`.
- Разное поведение цены и остатка при сплошь нулевом графике описано прямо, а не
  одним обещанием `None` на оба поля.
- `SECURITY.md` в русской секции утверждал, что учётных данных нет вообще,
  включая «ни требования заводить `.env`»; английское зеркало уже было
  поправлено, русское — нет.

- **`npm install jsdom` не работал так, как написано в README.** Проба искала
  модуль из корня репозитория и находила его, а раннер запускался из временного
  каталога, где Node его уже не видел. Девять DOM-тестов падали вместо того,
  чтобы честно скипнуться. Теперь проба возвращает путь, по которому jsdom
  нашёлся, и передаёт его раннеру через `NODE_PATH`.
- **Число офлайн-тестов в документации разошлось на три значения.** README писал
  812, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — 726, `AUDIT_REPORT.md` содержал и 822, и 726.
  Измеренное значение 822 теперь стоит везде.
- **Быстрый старт в README запускал живые тесты.** Команда `uv run pytest -q` с
  подписью «сеть не нужна» собирала четыре теста, которым сеть нужна, и у
  пользователя за пределами России падала на Wildberries. В примере теперь тот
  же фильтр, что в CI.
- **Шаг чек-листа проверял пустое множество.** `pytest -m "cdp"` собирает ноль
  тестов: маркер объявлен в `pyproject.toml`, но не стоит ни на одном тесте.
  Команда убрана, вместо неё сказано, что этот ярус проверяется вызовами
  `*_selfcheck` и сверкой глазами. Из `ARCHITECTURE.md` убрано утверждение, что
  CDP-тесты помечены маркером.
- Число заменяемых записей конфига в разных файлах стояло как «десять» и
  «двенадцать». Верное значение — одиннадцать: всего двенадцать серверов, и
  объединённый монтирует остальные одиннадцать.
- Абзац про карточку Lamoda дублировался в обеих языковых секциях этого файла.
- **Версия релиза не доехала до `__version__`.** Тринадцать пакетов сообщали
  бы `1.2.0` из установленного колеса с метаданными `1.2.1`. Ловится тем, что
  версию никто не сверял: она написана в пятидесяти пяти местах и правится
  руками. Теперь сверяет `scripts/check_versions.py` — он в гейте, в CI и в
  pre-commit, и именно он нашёл этот дефект.
- **`uv run mypy packages/*/src` не работает в PowerShell.** Глоб раскрывает
  оболочка, а PowerShell для нативных команд этого не делает, и mypy получал
  путь с звёздочкой буквально. В CI команда проходила (там bash), у владельца
  падала. Дерево переехало в `files` внутри `[tool.mypy]`, команда стала
  `uv run mypy` и ведёт себя одинаково везде.
- `npm install jsdom` оставляет рядом `package.json` и `package-lock.json` —
  оба добавлены в `.gitignore` вслед за `node_modules/`.
- «Бесценное объявление» заменено на «объявление без цены»: первое означает
  «неоценимо дорогое». Та же калька была в английском зеркале и в тексте навыка
  Авито.
- `node_modules/` добавлен в `.gitignore`.

### Изменено

- README получил раздел «Как это сделано» с прямым указанием, что код и
  документация писались с ИИ-ассистентами, и с перечнем того, чем это проверено.
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md` прошёл редакторскую правку: плотность тире снижена с одного
  на 45 слов до одного на 180, навязчивая антитеза «X, а не Y» убрана в
  большинстве мест. Числа, идентификаторы и вердикты не тронуты.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-28

Шесть новых маркетплейсов, объединённый сервер и настраиваемый CDP-хост. 41
инструмент в 11 серверах вместо 22 в 5. Имена и сигнатуры двадцати двух
инструментов 1.1.0 не менялись — только добавления.

### Добавлено

**Новые маркетплейсы**
- **Авито** (`avito_search`, `avito_card`, `avito_seller`, `avito_selfcheck`) —
  объявления через внутренний `js/items` API. Двухуровневый, как Ozon:
  TLS-имперсонация с резидентного IP, дальше ваш Chrome по CDP. Авито — это
  объявления, а не каталог: пула отзывов на товар нет, репутация продавца и есть
  сигнал доверия. Объявление без цены (обмен, даром, цена по запросу) приходит с
  `price_rub: null`, не `0`.
- **Taobao** (`taobao_search`, `taobao_card`, `taobao_selfcheck`) — поиск и
  карточки. Поиск Taobao — клиентское React-приложение с подписанным mtop API,
  поэтому все чтения идут внутри вашего Chrome, где сайт сам подписывает запросы.
  Цены в юанях (CNY) и не конвертируются: зашитый курс молча устарел бы.
- **Мегамаркет** (`megamarket_search`, `megamarket_card`, `megamarket_selfcheck`) —
  мобильный JSON API через CDP (ServicePipe). Отказ по IP (code 7) мапится в
  `transport_down`, а не в данные.
- **Lamoda** (`lamoda_search`, `lamoda_card`, `lamoda_selfcheck`) — карточки
  анонимно через GraphQL, поиск через CDP. Рейтингов у Lamoda нет нигде —
  `rating` не входит в схему GraphQL, и это задокументировано.
- **DNS-Shop** и **Ситилинк** (`dns_*`, `citilink_*` — поиск, карточка,
  selfcheck) — отрисованный DOM через CDP (Qrator proof-of-work). Бинарный
  gRPC-web Ситилинка осознанно не реверсится.

Четыре источника (Мегамаркет, Lamoda, DNS, Ситилинк) были отклонены в 1.0/1.1,
потому что анонимный пробинг не мог их подтвердить. CDP-уровень это изменил.
Их in-browser формы задокументированы в `docs/ANTI_BOT.md` и ждут живого
подтверждения из вашей сессии — именно это и показывают их `*_selfcheck`.

**Объединённый сервер**
- `marketplace-mcp` монтирует все установленные коннекторы как один namespaced
  набор инструментов — одна запись в конфиге клиента вместо одиннадцати. Имена
  инструментов (`wb_search`, `avito_seller`, …) не меняются.
- Операторский CLI: `marketplace-mcp install` печатает готовый блок
  `mcpServers`, `marketplace-mcp doctor` запускает все selfcheck разом плюс пробу
  CDP-сессии и умеет писать машиночитаемый JSON-снапшот (`--status-file`).

**Инфраструктура**
- `CHROME_CDP_HOST` в `mcp-core`: куда дозвониться CDP-клиенту (по умолчанию
  `127.0.0.1`). Из контейнера ставьте `chrome` (сайдкар) или
  `host.docker.internal` — tier-2 источники заработали в Docker без host
  networking. Автозапуск Chrome только на loopback: удалённый хост значит, что
  браузером управляете вы сами.
- `probe_session()` в `chrome_cdp`: health-check CDP-сессии для диагностики,
  никогда не бросает исключение.
- Адаптеры Avito и Taobao в `compare-connector`. Taobao отчитывается с ценами в
  юанях и **никогда не ранжируется** против рублёвых — зашитая конверсия
  сфабриковала бы выгоду.
- Ночная live-job в CI: канарейки реальных эндпоинтов по расписанию, отдельно от
  push-гейта.
- Контрактные тесты в `mcp-core` пинают инварианты: None-not-zero, файрвол ≠
  данные, блок ≠ отсутствие товара.
- Дрифт-защита в `yandex_search`: страница, где ни у одного товара нет цены или
  заголовка, предупреждает о вероятном дрейфе SSR вместо уверенного пустого ответа.
- Skills и examples для всех новых коннекторов, плюс `compare_with_china.py`.

### Изменено

- `docs/ANTI_BOT.md` переписан: четыре «отклонённых» источника теперь в разделе
  «требовавших CDP-уровня», с вердиктами под v1.2.0.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: tier-2 история обобщена на все challenge-gated источники
  и Chrome-сайдкар.
- `docker-compose.yml`: опциональный Chrome-сайдкар с named volume для профиля.
- `MarketOffer` в `compare-connector` получил поля `currency` и `price_native`.
  Рублёвые источники дублируют в `price_native` свою же цену, Taobao кладёт туда
  юани. Ранжирование теперь явно фильтрует по `currency == "rub"`, а не полагается
  на то, что `price_rub` случайно окажется `None`.
- `marketplace-mcp doctor` различает три исхода кодом возврата: `0` — всё здорово,
  `1` — дрейф парсера, `2` — проверить не удалось (блок, нет CDP, не тот регион).
  Раньше «ничего не смогли проверить» возвращало `0`, то есть выглядело как успех.
- `marketplace-mcp install` печатает реальный путь к вашей копии репозитория, а не
  заглушку `/path/to/...`, и отказывается печатать конфиг для неизвестного клиента.

### Исправлено

- **SSRF в `citilink_card` и `dns_card`.** Идентификатор товара доставался
  нежёстким `.search()` и служил только пропуском, а навигация шла по исходной
  строке. Ссылка вида `https://чужой-хост/product/<24-hex>/` проходила проверку и
  открывалась в Chrome оператора со всеми его куками. Теперь хост проверяется, а
  URL собирается из `SITE_BASE` по извлечённому id. Добавлены регрессионные тесты
  на шесть враждебных форм ввода, включая scheme-relative и `javascript:`.
- **Docker-образ не собирался.** Слой зависимостей копировал 6 манифестов из 13, и
  `uv sync --all-packages --frozen` падал на `Distribution not found`. Копируются
  все тринадцать.
- **Молчаливый дрейф парсера в `megamarket_search`.** Ответ, разобранный в ноль
  товаров, отдавался как успех, и `compare_prices` считал сравнение полным, хотя
  Мегамаркет не дал ничего. Теперь отсутствие самого массива товаров и `total > 0`
  без разобранных позиций поднимают `parser_drift`. Пустой массив под известным
  ключом по-прежнему честный нулевой результат.
- **Шесть коннекторов сообщали чужую версию.** Avito, Taobao, Мегамаркет, Lamoda,
  DNS и Ситилинк не передавали `version` в `FastMCP`, поэтому клиенту по протоколу
  уходила версия библиотеки FastMCP (3.4.4) вместо 1.2.0. Видно только в живой
  MCP-сессии — статическая проверка `SERVER_VERSION` этого не ловит.
- **Прокси-пароль утекал в логи.** `redact` не вырезал `user:pass@` из URL, а прокси
  настраивается именно такой строкой, так что ошибка соединения уносила логин и
  пароль в stderr и в ответ клиенту.
- **`marketplace-connector` не объявлял ни одного коннектора** в зависимостях, хотя
  монтирует одиннадцать: установка пакета отдельно давала пустой сервер, потому что
  `ImportError` глушится по замыслу. Новый инструмент `marketplace_sources`
  показывает, что смонтировано и почему остальное пропущено.
- **`avito-connector` не объявлял `playwright`**, хотя импортирует CDP-транспорт:
  на чистой установке падал при первом же бане. Extra `mcp-core[cdp]` тянул
  `websockets`, хотя транспорт работает через Playwright.
- `compare_prices` схлопывает дубликаты по паре «источник и id товара». Один и тот
  же товар мог занять и первое, и второе место и выглядеть как два независимых
  подтверждения цены.
- `shape_signature()` в `mcp-core` наконец существует: `ARCHITECTURE.md` и docstring
  ссылались на функцию, которой не было ни в одном файле.
- Ситилинк отдавал пользователю ошибки «DNS navigation blocked» и открывал свой
  модуль строкой про DNS — копипаста из соседнего коннектора.
- В CI появились проверка `check_no_print.py` (была только в pre-commit), `UV_FROZEN: 1`
  и живая MCP-сессия по stdio для всех двенадцати серверов.
- **Мегамаркет: последняя причина — редирект на категорию.** `/catalog/?q=ноутбук`
  площадка перенаправляет на `/catalog/noutbuki/`, и url/parse отвечает
  `collection: None` для общего поискового URL, но настоящей коллекцией для той
  категории, куда редирект ведёт. Мы отправляли в url/parse неперенаправленный
  URL, поэтому коллекции не было и поиск возвращал `listingSize > 0` с пустым
  `items` даже после исправления тела и адреса. Редирект теперь проходится в
  браузере, и в url/parse уходит финальный URL. Подтверждено живьём: коллекция
  502202, 44 товара.
- Разобранные параметры поиска кэшируются на запрос: каждое разрешение стоит
  навигации в браузере плюс вызова API, а агент задаёт один и тот же вопрос
  многократно.
- Офлайн-набор перестал спать на живом пейсере. Тесты Мегамаркета и Lamoda
  прогоняли настоящий `_polite_wait` с трёхсекундным интервалом, и «офлайн»
  прогон занимал 93 секунды вместо шести. Плюс шаг редиректа в тестах пытался
  дотянуться до Chrome.
- **Мегамаркет искал, не спросив у Мегамаркета, что значит запрос.** Даже с
  верными именами полей, резолвленным адресом и `requestVersion: 10` поиск
  отвечал `listingSize > 0` и пустым `items`. Пропущенного не было в теле — не
  было самого запроса: текстовый запрос площадка сначала разбирает через
  `urlService/url/parse` и выдаёт предполагаемую коллекцию, а поиск ждёт её в
  `collectionId` и `selectedAssumedCollectionId`. Без них листингу нечего
  перечислять. `xob0t/mmparser` тоже никогда не собирает тело из строки: он
  сначала отправляет каталожный URL в url/parse. Теперь так же, плюс коды
  фильтров (`LEFT_BOUND` → 1) конвертируются как ждёт эндпоинт. Если url/parse
  недоступен, поиск всё равно идёт — просто без подсказок.
- **Мегамаркет не передавал адрес доставки, и поиск возвращал ноль товаров.**
  Живой прогон из залогиненной сессии с пройденным челленджем: HTTP 200,
  `success: true`, `listingSize: 44`, `items: []`. Не блок, не разлогин, не
  уехавшая схема — в запросе не было адреса. У каждого предложения свои
  `deliveryPossibilities`, поэтому без адреса доставляемых предложений нет, а
  `listingSize` продолжает считать найденное в каталоге. Адрес теперь
  резолвится: сначала адрес по умолчанию из профиля (тогда цены совпадают с
  тем, что оператор видит на сайте), иначе город из `MEGAMARKET_ADDRESS` через
  публичный suggest. Непустой `listingSize` с пустым `items` больше не выдаётся
  за честный ноль — это ошибка с указанием, что настроить.
- **Мегамаркет посылал неполное тело запроса и читал не ту схему.** Поиск уходил
  как `{"text", "page"}` — API принимает такое с HTTP 200 и отвечает пустым
  `items`, неотличимым от «ничего не нашлось». Реальный конверт требует
  `searchText`, `requestVersion`, `limit`/`offset` и ещё десяток полей; страницы
  считаются смещением, а не номером. Вдобавок элемент результата не плоский:
  товар лежит в `goods`, цена в `favoriteOffer`, а `goodsId` несёт суффикс
  продавца. И карточка стучалась в `productCard/get`, которого в API нет, вместо
  `productCardMainInfo/get`. Схема выверена по поддерживаемому `xob0t/mmparser`,
  который ходит в тот же endpoint.
- `is_available` из поиска Мегамаркета больше не теряется: новое поле в ответе,
  и `compare_prices` берёт из него наличие вместо жёсткого `None`.
- **Карточка Lamoda не читалась из-за двух ошибок сразу, обе проверены живьём.**
  Запрос просил поле `old_price`, которого нет: эндпоинт отвечает HTTP 200 и
  `{"error": "Internal server error", "code": -32603}` вообще без данных.
  Published-имя — `old_price_amount`. Но и с верным полем парсер бы не нашёл
  товар: у Lamoda нестандартный конверт — товары в `result`, а не в
  `data.products`, а ошибка приходит одной строкой `error`, а не массивом
  `errors`. Неизвестный SKU даёт `result: null`, и это честный not_found, а не
  дрейф. Все три конверта сняты с живого эндпоинта и лежат в тестах.
- В JS-экстракторе Lamoda `\/p\/` записывался как `\/p\/` в неraw-строке —
  Python это терпит с предупреждением и сломает в будущей версии.
- **Поиск Ситилинка и DNS теперь читает и вложенные фреймы.** Живая проверка с
  резидентного IP показала раскладку, где все 27 товарных ссылок лежат в iframe,
  а в верхнем документе их нет ни одной. Экстрактор читал только `document` и на
  такой странице честно сообщал дрейф при исправном парсере — отсюда и плавающий
  результат между прогонами.
- **`compare_prices` предупреждает про товар в другом состоянии.** На живом
  запросе «iphone 15» дешёвые позиции Wildberries оказались «Восстановленный» и
  «Витринный образец» — их ранжировало против новых телефонов. Словарь
  аксессуаров такое не ловит, и разрыв в треть цены не дотягивает до проверки по
  медиане, так что нужен был отдельный признак.
- **Пейсинг переехал в `mcp-core` и научился отступать.** Восемь коннекторов
  носили по своей копии `_polite_wait`, и ни одна не отличала успешный запрос от
  отказа. Живой прогон в июле 2026 показал цену этого: Taobao и DNS сначала стали
  здоровыми, а потом развалились после серии запросов подряд. Общий `Pacer`
  держит паузу между запросами, удлиняет её после отказа и считает отказы
  подряд: после нескольких он говорит оператору сменить адрес или перелогиниться
  вместо шестого одинакового «заблокировано». Публичные парсеры этих площадок
  живут ровно на этих трёх привычках.
- **Мегамаркет больше не путает разлогин с отсутствием товара.** Пустой `items`
  при пройденном ServicePipe — это неавторизованная сессия, а не сломанный
  парсер: с начала 2025 площадка отвечает анонимному клиенту пустотой, а не
  ошибкой (это же описывает публичный mmparser). Selfcheck теперь отдаёт
  `inconclusive` с причиной `not_authenticated` вместо `drift`, а поиск
  прикладывает предупреждение. Пропавший массив по-прежнему `parser_drift`,
  а `total > 0` без разобранных позиций — тоже.
- Появился `.editorconfig`: отступы и переводы строк для тех, чей редактор не
  читает pyproject.
- **`doctor` скрывал причину, по которой проверка не удалась.** Коннекторы
  классифицируют отказ (`rate_limited`, `blocked`, `transport_down` с HTTP-кодом),
  но CLI печатал только слово `inconclusive`. Три разные ситуации с тремя разными
  действиями выглядели одинаково. Причина и код теперь в выводе.
- `compare_prices` предупреждает, когда самое дешёвое предложение похоже на
  аксессуар, а не на искомый товар, и когда его цена вдвое ниже медианы по
  остальным. Только предупреждение: порог, подобранный без живых выдач, не
  должен получать право что-то скрывать. Поводом стал живой прогон, где по
  запросу iPhone 15 предложение за 34 224 ₽ обошло настоящие за 52 049 ₽.
- `scripts/diagnose_drift.py` научился зонду для Мегамаркета (API вместо DOM,
  форма ответа через `shape_signature`) и различает «селектор уехал» и «товары
  вообще не в DOM, а в JSON-состоянии» — случай Lamoda.
- **DNS и Ситилинк не находили ни одного товара.** `_PRODUCT_ID_RE` требовал 24
  hex-символа — формат MongoDB ObjectId, которого нет ни на одной из площадок:
  Ситилинк отдаёт `/product/noutbuk-lenovo-2169270/`, DNS `/product/b7a1667f9b19ed20/`.
  Поиск разбирался в ноль плиток и уходил в `parser_drift`. Баг дожил до релиза
  потому, что фикстуры выдумывали id в том же неверном формате, которого ждал
  парсер, — тесты соглашались с ошибкой. Теперь в них реальные маршруты,
  снятые с живой сессии, и отдельная проверка, что JS в странице и Python-парсер
  читают один и тот же набор символов.

### Что нашла независимая перепроверка перед выпуском

Перед выпуском релиз прошёл сплошной аудит: весь гейт воспроизведён с нуля, а
часть источников сверена с живыми страницами. Ниже — то, что он изменил.

#### Исправлено

- **Цена могла оказаться платежом по рассрочке.** Экстракторы выбирали цену как
  наименьшее число на плитке, а плитка DNS показывает «от 5 751 ₽/ мес.» рядом с
  ценой 58 999 ₽. Такое значение проходит валидацию и выглядит правдоподобно —
  то есть хуже, чем пустое поле. Ценой теперь считается только число,
  привязанное к знаку валюты; рассрочка, бонусы, бейдж скидки и счётчик пунктов
  выдачи отбрасываются.
- **`dns_search` отдавал 24 ссылки с `title=None` и `price=None`.** Плитка
  искалась через `closest()`, а он проверяет сам элемент раньше предков: первый
  товарный якорь в плитке DNS — ссылка на картинку, у которой нет текста.
  Замерено на снятой сетке: у найденного узла `textContent` длиной 0 против 402
  у настоящего корня плитки.
- **Ситилинк не находил цену никогда** — знак ₽ у него лежит в отдельном
  элементе от цифр, а старый фильтр требовал их в одной текстовой строке.
  Экстрактор переведён на стабильные атрибуты `data-meta-*`, которые сайт держит
  для своей аналитики, вместо классов, меняющихся каждой сборкой.
- **`avito_search` падал целиком из-за одного вложенного поля** — `location`
  приходит объектом, а не строкой. На живом ответе вскрылись ещё два дефекта: у
  каждого результата отсутствовала ссылка (настоящий ключ `urlPath`, а искали
  `uriPath` — одна буква) и дата публикации (её нет строкой, только
  `sortTimeStamp` в миллисекундах).
- **`wb_search` за концом выдачи отдавал первую страницу под видом новой.**
  Проверено живьём: `page=20` вернула те же 100 товаров в том же порядке, что и
  `page=1`, с HTTP 200 и без признака, тогда как докстринг обещал в этом случае
  `WbNoResultsResponse`. Коннектор запоминает отпечаток первой страницы и,
  встретив его снова, отвечает так, как обещано. Собственный `total` от WB для
  этого непригоден — он больше реально отдаваемой глубины.
- Экстракторы читают `textContent`, а не `innerText`: последний зависит от
  раскладки и видимости, то есть ровно от того, что различается между прогретой
  вкладкой и только что открытой.

#### Добавлено

- Тесты, которые прогоняют **настоящий JS коннектора** по снятой разметке (через
  jsdom) и сверяют результат с ценами, которые в тот момент были на странице:
  `dns-connector` и `citilink-connector`. Раньше экстракторы не исполнял ни один
  из 707 тестов — дефекты жили точно в непокрытом слое. Без jsdom DOM-половина
  честно скипается, питоновская идёт всегда.
- Фикстура живого ответа Авито и контрактные тесты по ней: форма `location`,
  цена из `priceDetailed.value`, наличие ссылки у каждого результата, ISO-дата.
- Общий слой извлечения `mcp_core.dom` (разрешение плитки и выбор цены) и
  харнесс `mcp_core.domtest` — вместо четырёх копий, расходившихся по-разному.
- `test_skills_parity.py`: коннектор без навыка, навык с несуществующим
  инструментом, забытый инструмент и несоответствие опубликованному контракту
  frontmatter теперь роняют прогон.

#### Навыки

- Навык DNS требовал ссылку вида `/product/<24-hex>/` — тот самый шаблон, который
  чинили как баг. Настоящий id у DNS 16-hex, у Ситилинка — слаг с числом. Это
  жило ещё и в описаниях параметров `dns_card`/`citilink_card` и в текстах их
  ошибок, то есть в контракте, который MCP-клиент показывает модели.
- У WB не были описаны `wb_questions` и `wb_category_products`: навык учил
  получить дерево категорий и не давал инструмента, чтобы по нему сходить.
- Навыки DNS и Ситилинка советовали проверять раскладку через `selfcheck` — при
  том что DNS это ровно тот случай, где selfcheck позеленел при пустых данных.
- Навыки поехали вместе с серверами: `Dockerfile` копирует `skills/` в образ, а
  `.dockerignore` получил исключение `!skills/**/SKILL.md` — без него `COPY`
  положил бы в образ пустые каталоги. README получил раздел о навыках.

#### Документация

- Числа приведены к измеренным: 822 теста, покрытие 77.7 %.
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md` переписан. Прошлая версия утверждала «10/10 источников
  healthy» рядом с приложенным `doctor-status.json`, где 7 healthy, 2
  inconclusive и 1 drift; оба утверждения не могли быть верны.
- `ADDING_A_SOURCE.md` больше не пишет, что «Lamoda была отвергнута» — Lamoda
  поставляется; описан реальный случай: карточки по GraphQL, поиска в нём нет.
- `ANTI_BOT.md` больше не пишет «DNS went healthy». Записана честная
  последовательность: правка регулярки id позеленила `selfcheck`, а данные
  остались пустыми.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-30 (English)

New MPStats connector — the first paid source in the project. Until now every
server worked over anonymous scrape endpoints with no keys; MPStats is a
different kind: an analytics layer over Ozon/Wildberries with a quota and an
account. It is optional: without `MPSTATS_MP_AUTH` the server boots, the tools
answer `auth_missing`, and the other twelve servers behave exactly as before.

The connector's original code came from [@Xpos587](https://github.com/Xpos587) in
[PR #5](https://github.com/Vladimir-Human/ru-marketplace-mcp/pull/5). It was
reworked here for the invariants the rest of the project holds to, but the idea,
the plugin API work and the parser structure are his.

### Added

**New `mpstats-mcp` server (3 tools)**
- `mpstats_item(skus, place, oz_fbs=True)` — 30-day sales/price/stock analytics
  for up to 100 Ozon or Wildberries SKUs: 4 per-day graphs (orders, prices,
  stock, categories), current price/stock (last non-zero graph cell),
  seller/brand, `totals` aggregates (orders/sum/sum_prev), rolling
  `orders_per_day`.
- `mpstats_warehouses(skus, place)` — warehouse stock split: FBS (seller's
  warehouse) and FBO (marketplace warehouse), plus upstream `last_update`.
- `mpstats_selfcheck()` — tri-state canary: `success` / `drift_detected` /
  `inconclusive`. A missing token and transport failures report `inconclusive`,
  not `drift`, so the maintainer is not sent hunting a schema drift that never
  happened.

**Auth.** Endpoint `POST plugin.mpstats.io/pluginapi` (RPC style: method in the
`Request` field, parameters as `Sku`/`Place`/`ozFBS`). Auth is a single
`mp_auth` cookie (JWT from a logged-in plugin session at mpstats.io), set via
`MPSTATS_MP_AUTH`. Per the author's report: a cold replay with only `mp_auth`
answers 200 with data; without it the body is
`{"code":403,"message":"Unauthorized"}` behind HTTP 200 — that inner code maps
to `auth_missing` so an auth failure does not read as "no data". The token is a
secret on a paid, quota-billed account; it is never logged or committed.

**Transport.** Tier 1 (httpx) but POST-only, so instead of the GET-only
`get_text_budgeted` from `mcp-core` the connector carries a local
`_post_json_budgeted` helper with the same invariants: byte cap, wall-clock
budget, classified errors, retries of transport failures only, a polite gate
between attempts. No POST path was added to `mcp-core` on purpose: POST is
needed by one connector, and promoting it to the shared runtime would grow the
test surface for everyone.

**Parsers.** Graphs are `days` long (30 by default), oldest first: the last
non-zero cell is the current price/stock, a delisted SKU yields `None`, not a
false `0`. A zero cell means "no data for that day", not "the value was zero".
`coerce_int`/`coerce_price` refuse to guess ambiguous shapes (signs, price
ranges) — `None` instead of a plausibly-wrong number. 52 offline tests cover
the parsers, the error contract, the auth gate, the tri-state selfcheck and the
`_post_json_budgeted` transport (byte cap, wall-clock budget, retries of
transport faults only, classified errors).

**Also.** `mpstats-mcp` is mounted into the unified `marketplace-mcp` (now 45
tools: 44 mounted plus `marketplace_sources`), added to `doctor`, the registry
entry in `server.json`, the `skills/mpstats-connector` skill, README (RU+EN),
and the CI tool-count.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-28 (English)

A patch release following an outside review. Tool behaviour is unchanged; the
fixes cover documentation and one module path in the test harness.

### Fixed

- **`npm install jsdom` did not work the way the README described it.** The
  probe resolved the module from the repository root and found it, while the
  runner executed from a temp directory where Node could not. Nine DOM tests
  failed instead of skipping. The probe now reports where jsdom was found and
  hands that path to the runner through `NODE_PATH`.
- **The offline test count disagreed with itself across three files.** README
  said 812, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` said 726, `AUDIT_REPORT.md` carried both 822
  and 726. The measured figure, 822, is now used everywhere.
- **The README quickstart ran live tests.** `uv run pytest -q`, labelled "no
  network needed", collected four tests that need one and failed on Wildberries
  for anyone outside Russia. The example now uses the same filter as CI.
- **A checklist step verified an empty set.** `pytest -m "cdp"` collects zero
  tests, because the marker is declared but carried by none. The command is gone;
  the checklist now says this tier is exercised through `*_selfcheck` calls and
  by comparing against the site. `ARCHITECTURE.md` no longer claims CDP tests are
  marked.
- The number of config entries the unified server replaces was written as ten in
  one file and twelve in another. It is eleven.
- A Lamoda paragraph was duplicated in both language sections of this file.
- **The release version never reached `__version__`.** Thirteen packages would
  have reported `1.2.0` from a wheel whose metadata said `1.2.1`. A version
  string is written in fifty-five places here and was compared by nobody;
  `scripts/check_versions.py` now compares them, in the gate, in CI and in
  pre-commit — and it found this defect.
- **`uv run mypy packages/*/src` does not work in PowerShell,** which does not
  expand globs for native commands, so mypy received the path with a literal
  asterisk: green in CI on bash, red on the maintainer's machine. The file list
  moved into `[tool.mypy]` and the command is now plain `uv run mypy`.
- `npm install jsdom` also leaves `package.json` and `package-lock.json`; both
  join `node_modules/` in `.gitignore`.
- "Бесценное объявление" means an invaluable listing, not one without a price;
  reworded here, in the English mirror and in the Avito skill.
- `node_modules/` is now ignored.

### Changed

- The README gained a "How this was built" section stating plainly that the code
  and documentation were written with AI assistants, and listing what verifies them.
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md` was copy-edited: dash density dropped from one per 45 words to
  one per 180, and the repeated "X, not Y" antithesis is mostly gone. Numbers,
  identifiers and verdicts were left untouched.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-28 (English)

Six new marketplaces, a unified server, and a configurable CDP host. 41 tools
across 11 servers, up from 22 across 5. The 22 v1.1.0 tool names and signatures
are unchanged — additions only.

### Added

**New marketplaces**
- **Avito** (`avito_search`, `avito_card`, `avito_seller`, `avito_selfcheck`) —
  classifieds via the internal `js/items` API. Two-tier like Ozon: TLS
  impersonation from a residential IP, then your Chrome over CDP. Avito is
  classifieds, not a catalog: no per-item reviews — seller reputation is the
  trust signal. A listing with no price (swap, free, price on request) reports `price_rub: null`, never `0`.
- **Taobao** (`taobao_search`, `taobao_card`, `taobao_selfcheck`) — search and
  cards. Taobao search is a client-side React app over the signed mtop API, so
  every read runs inside your Chrome where the site signs requests natively.
  Prices stay in yuan (CNY): a baked-in rate would go silently stale.
- **Megamarket** (`megamarket_search`, `megamarket_card`,
  `megamarket_selfcheck`) — mobile JSON API via CDP (ServicePipe). The code-7 IP
  refusal maps to `transport_down`, not data.
- **Lamoda** (`lamoda_search`, `lamoda_card`, `lamoda_selfcheck`) — anonymous
  GraphQL cards plus CDP-backed search. Lamoda exposes no ratings anywhere.
- **DNS-Shop** and **Citilink** (`dns_*`, `citilink_*`) — rendered DOM via CDP
  (Qrator proof-of-work). Citilink's binary gRPC-web is deliberately not reversed.

Four sources were rejected in v1.0/v1.1 because anonymous probing could not
confirm them end to end. The CDP tier changed that. Their in-browser shapes are
documented in `docs/ANTI_BOT.md` and await live confirmation from your session —
exactly what their `*_selfcheck` tools report.

**Unified server**
- `marketplace-mcp` mounts every installed connector as one namespaced toolset —
  one client config entry instead of ten. Tool names keep their prefixes.
- Operator CLI: `marketplace-mcp install` prints the `mcpServers` block,
  `marketplace-mcp doctor` runs every selfcheck plus a CDP session probe, with an
  optional machine-readable JSON snapshot (`--status-file`).

**Infrastructure**
- `CHROME_CDP_HOST` in `mcp-core`: where the CDP client dials (default
  `127.0.0.1`). From a container set `chrome` (sidecar) or
  `host.docker.internal` — tier-2 sources work in Docker without host networking.
  Chrome autostart is loopback-only.
- `probe_session()` in `chrome_cdp`: a never-raising CDP session health-check.
- Avito and Taobao adapters in `compare-connector`. Taobao reports yuan prices
  and is **never ranked** against rubles.
- Nightly live CI canaries, separate from the push gate.
- Contract tests pinning invariants: None-not-zero, firewall ≠ data, blocked ≠
  absent.
- `yandex_search` drift guard: a page where every product lost its price or
  title warns of likely SSR drift instead of a confident empty answer.
- Skills and examples for every new connector, plus `compare_with_china.py`.

### Changed

- `docs/ANTI_BOT.md` rewritten: the four "rejected" sources moved to a
  "needed the CDP tier" section with v1.2.0 verdicts.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: the tier-2 story generalised across challenge-gated
  sources and the Chrome sidecar.
- `docker-compose.yml`: optional Chrome sidecar with a named profile volume.
- `MarketOffer` in `compare-connector` gained `currency` and `price_native`.
  Rouble sources mirror their own price into `price_native`; Taobao puts yuan
  there. Ranking now filters on `currency == "rub"` explicitly instead of relying
  on `price_rub` happening to be `None`.
- `marketplace-mcp doctor` separates three outcomes by exit code: `0` healthy,
  `1` parser drift, `2` could not be judged (blocked, no CDP, wrong region).
  "We checked nothing" used to exit `0`, which reads as success.
- `marketplace-mcp install` prints the real path to your checkout instead of a
  `/path/to/...` placeholder, and refuses to print a config for an unknown client.

### Fixed

- **SSRF in `citilink_card` and `dns_card`.** The product id came out of an
  unanchored `.search()` and acted only as a gate — navigation used the original
  string. A URL like `https://attacker.example/product/<24-hex>/` passed validation
  and opened in the operator's Chrome with all its cookies. The host is now checked
  and the URL rebuilt from `SITE_BASE` around the extracted id, with regression
  tests covering six hostile inputs including scheme-relative and `javascript:`.
- **The Docker image did not build.** The dependency layer copied 6 of 13 manifests,
  so `uv sync --all-packages --frozen` failed with `Distribution not found`. All
  thirteen are copied now.
- **Silent parser drift in `megamarket_search`.** A response that parsed to zero
  items returned success, and `compare_prices` then called the comparison complete
  while Megamarket had contributed nothing. A missing items container, or `total > 0`
  with nothing parsed, now raises `parser_drift`. An empty array under a known key
  is still an honest zero-result answer.
- **Six connectors advertised the wrong version.** Avito, Taobao, Megamarket,
  Lamoda, DNS and Citilink never passed `version` to `FastMCP`, so the protocol
  handshake reported the FastMCP library version (3.4.4) rather than 1.2.0. Only a
  live MCP session shows this; grepping `SERVER_VERSION` does not.
- **Proxy passwords leaked into logs.** `redact` did not strip `user:pass@` from a
  URL, and proxies are configured as exactly that, so a connect error carried the
  credentials into stderr and into the client's error text.
- **`marketplace-connector` declared none of the connectors** it mounts, so
  installing the package on its own produced an empty server — the `ImportError` is
  swallowed by design. A new `marketplace_sources` tool reports what mounted and why
  anything else was skipped.
- **`avito-connector` did not declare `playwright`** despite importing the CDP
  transport, so a clean install died at the first ban. The `mcp-core[cdp]` extra
  pulled `websockets` although the transport runs on Playwright.
- `compare_prices` collapses duplicates on (source, product id). One listing could
  otherwise take both first and second place and read as two independent
  confirmations of a price.
- `shape_signature()` exists in `mcp-core` at last: `ARCHITECTURE.md` and a docstring
  referenced a function that was in no file.
- Citilink returned "DNS navigation blocked" to users and opened its module with a
  line about DNS — copy-paste from the neighbouring connector.
- CI gained the `check_no_print.py` guard (previously pre-commit only), `UV_FROZEN: 1`,
  and a real stdio MCP session against all twelve servers.
- **Megamarket: the last cause was a search-to-category redirect.**
  `/catalog/?q=ноутбук` redirects to `/catalog/noutbuki/`, and url/parse answers
  `collection: None` for the generic search URL but a real collection for the
  category it lands on. We were posting the un-redirected URL, so there was no
  collection and search kept returning `listingSize > 0` with an empty `items`
  even after the body and the address were fixed. The redirect is now followed in
  the browser and the final URL goes to url/parse. Verified live: collection
  502202, 44 items.
- Resolved search params are cached per query: each resolution costs a browser
  navigation plus an API call, and an agent asks the same question repeatedly.
- The offline suite no longer sleeps on the real pacer. Megamarket and Lamoda
  tests were running the real `_polite_wait` with its three-second gap, turning
  an "offline" run into 93 seconds instead of six. The redirect step was also
  reaching for Chrome from tests.
- **Megamarket searched without asking Megamarket what the query means.** Even
  with the right field names, a resolved address and `requestVersion: 10`, search
  answered `listingSize > 0` with an empty `items`. What was missing was not in
  the body but a request we never made: the site parses a text query through
  `urlService/url/parse` into an assumed collection, and the search endpoint
  expects it in `collectionId` and `selectedAssumedCollectionId`. Without them the
  listing has nothing to list. `xob0t/mmparser` never builds a body from a query
  either — it POSTs the catalog URL to url/parse first. We now do the same, and
  convert filter bounds (`LEFT_BOUND` → 1) to the codes the endpoint wants. If
  url/parse is unavailable the search still runs, just without the hints.
- **Megamarket sent no delivery address, so search returned zero products.**
  A live run from a logged-in, challenge-passed session answered HTTP 200 with
  `success: true`, `listingSize: 44` and `items: []`. Not a block, not a
  logged-out session, not a moved shape — the request carried no address. Every
  offer has its own `deliveryPossibilities`, so with no address there is no
  deliverable offer while `listingSize` still counts what the catalog matched.
  The address is now resolved: the profile's default address first, so prices
  match what the operator sees on the site, then the `MEGAMARKET_ADDRESS` city
  through the public suggest endpoint. A positive `listingSize` with an empty
  `items` array is no longer passed off as an honest zero — it is an error that
  names the setting to change.
- **Megamarket posted an incomplete request body and read the wrong shape.**
  Search went out as `{"text", "page"}`, which the API accepts with HTTP 200 and
  answers with an empty `items` array — indistinguishable from "nothing matched".
  The real envelope needs `searchText`, `requestVersion` and `limit`/`offset`
  paging plus a dozen more fields. A result item is also not flat: the product
  nests under `goods`, its price under `favoriteOffer`, and `goodsId` carries a
  merchant suffix. The card hit `productCard/get`, which is not part of the API,
  instead of `productCardMainInfo/get`. Schema verified against the maintained
  `xob0t/mmparser`, which drives the same endpoint.
- Megamarket's per-item `is_available` is no longer dropped: it reaches the
  response as a new field and `compare_prices` reads stock from it instead of
  hardcoding `None`.
- **The Lamoda card failed on two bugs at once, both verified live.** The query
  asked for `old_price`, which does not exist: the endpoint answers HTTP 200 and
  `{"error": "Internal server error", "code": -32603}` with no data at all. The
  published name is `old_price_amount`. Even with the right field the parser
  would have missed the product: Lamoda's envelope is not the standard one —
  products sit under `result` rather than `data.products`, and a failure arrives
  as a single `error` string rather than an `errors` array. An unknown SKU
  returns `result: null`, which is an honest not_found rather than drift. All
  three envelopes were captured from the live endpoint and are pinned in tests.
- Fixed an invalid escape in Lamoda's JS extractor string, which Python tolerates
  with a warning today and will reject in a future version.
- **Citilink and DNS search now read nested frames too.** A live check from a
  residential IP found a layout where all 27 product links sit inside an iframe
  and the top-level document holds none. The extractor read only `document`, so
  on that layout it reported drift with a perfectly good parser — which is what
  made the result flicker between runs.
- **`compare_prices` warns about a different product condition.** On a live
  "iphone 15" query the cheap Wildberries rows were "Восстановленный" and
  "Витринный образец" — a refurbished phone and a display unit, ranked against
  new ones. The accessory list cannot catch that, and a third off the median is
  not steep enough for the outlier check, so it needed its own signal.
- **Pacing moved into `mcp-core` and learned to back off.** Eight connectors each
  carried a copy of `_polite_wait`, and not one of them knew a successful request
  from a refusal. The live July 2026 run showed what that costs: Taobao and DNS
  both went healthy and then fell over after a burst of back-to-back calls. The
  shared `Pacer` holds a gap between requests, lengthens it after a refusal, and
  counts consecutive refusals — after a few it tells the operator to change the
  address or refresh the session instead of returning a sixth identical
  "blocked". The public parsers that survive on these marketplaces live on
  exactly those three habits.
- **Megamarket no longer confuses a logged-out session with an absent product.**
  An empty `items` array behind a passed ServicePipe challenge means the session
  is not authenticated, not that the parser broke: since early 2025 the site
  answers an anonymous client with emptiness rather than an error, which the
  public mmparser project documents too. Selfcheck now reports `inconclusive`
  with reason `not_authenticated` instead of `drift`, and search attaches a
  warning. A missing array is still `parser_drift`, and so is `total > 0` with
  nothing parsed.
- Added `.editorconfig` for contributors whose editor does not read pyproject.
- **`doctor` hid why a check could not be judged.** Connectors classify the
  refusal (`rate_limited`, `blocked`, `transport_down`, with the HTTP code) but the
  CLI printed only the word `inconclusive`. Three situations needing three
  different responses looked identical. The reason and code now show.
- `compare_prices` warns when the cheapest offer reads as an accessory rather than
  the product searched for, and when its price sits below half the median of the
  rest. Warnings only: a threshold tuned without live data has no business hiding
  a row. Prompted by a live run where an iPhone 15 query ranked a 34 224 ₽ listing
  above genuine 52 049 ₽ ones.
- `scripts/diagnose_drift.py` gained a Megamarket probe (API rather than DOM,
  envelope fingerprinted with `shape_signature`) and now separates "the selector
  moved" from "the products are not in the DOM at all, they are in JSON state" —
  the Lamoda case.
- **DNS and Citilink found no products at all.** `_PRODUCT_ID_RE` demanded 24 hex
  characters — a MongoDB ObjectId shape neither site uses: Citilink serves
  `/product/noutbuk-lenovo-2169270/`, DNS `/product/b7a1667f9b19ed20/`. Search
  parsed zero tiles and reported `parser_drift`. It shipped because the fixtures
  invented ids in the same wrong shape the parser expected, so the suite agreed
  with the bug. They now carry routes observed on a live session, plus a check
  that the in-page JS and the Python parser read the same id charset.

### Found by the pre-release audit

The release went through a full independent audit: every gate reproduced from
scratch, and part of the sources compared against live pages.

- **A price could be read as the instalment shown beside it.** Extractors took
  the smallest number on a tile, and a DNS tile advertises "от 5 751 ₽/ мес."
  next to a 58 999 ₽ price. That validates and looks plausible — worse than a
  null. A price is now only a number attached to a currency glyph.
- **DNS search returned 24 links with no title and no price.** Tiles were
  resolved with `closest()`, which tests the element itself before any ancestor
  and so landed on the image link, which carries no text.
- **Citilink never found a price** — it renders the ₽ glyph in an element
  separate from the digits. The extractor now keys on Citilink's stable
  `data-meta-*` attributes rather than its build-hashed class names.
- **Avito search failed entirely over one nested field** (`location` arrives as
  an object). The live payload also showed every search hit missing its URL
  (`urlPath`, not `uriPath`) and its publication date (`sortTimeStamp` in epoch
  milliseconds; there is no date string in the response at all).
- **Wildberries search served page 1 again past the end of the result set** —
  `page=20` returned the same 100 products in the same order as `page=1`, HTTP
  200, no marker, while the docstring promised a no-results response.
- Extraction moved into a shared `mcp_core.dom` layer, and tests now run the
  connectors' real JavaScript against captured markup instead of mocking the
  render call away — the layer where all of the above had been hiding.
- Every connector's skill is now checked against the code by
  `test_skills_parity.py`, and the skills ship inside the Docker image.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-26

Технический долг, дыры в функциональности и два новых инструмента Wildberries.
Имена и сигнатуры двадцати инструментов версии 1.0.0 не менялись: на них завязаны
конфиги MCP-клиентов, так что только добавления.

### Добавлено

**Новые инструменты Wildberries**
- `wb_questions(imt_id, limit, skip, answered_only)` — вопросы покупателей и ответы
  продавца. Отзывы рассказывают, каково владеть товаром; вопросы уточняют, что это
  за товар. Ответ продавца часто единственное публичное утверждение о том, чего нет
  в описании. Эндпоинт проверен живьём на шести товарах до того, как была написана
  первая строка кода: у него три ловушки, каждая из которых выглядит как пустой
  результат, а не как ошибка. Подробности в `docs/ANTI_BOT.md`.
- `wb_category_products(shard, query, page, sort, dest)` — товары категории по
  `shard` и `query`, которые отдаёт `wb_categories`. Раньше эти селекторы было
  некуда применить. Формат элементов совпадает с `wb_search`, поэтому обход
  категорий и текстовый поиск сравнимы напрямую.

**Регион Детского мира на каждый вызов**
- У всех четырёх инструментов появился параметр `region`, он перекрывает
  `DETMIR_REGION`. До этого сменить город можно было только перезапуском сервера,
  что посреди диалога с агентом невозможно.

**Кэш и прокси у Wildberries и Ozon**
- `WB_CACHE_TTL`, `WB_PROXY`, `OZON_CACHE_TTL`, `OZON_PROXY`. README и SECURITY
  обещали `*_PROXY` у всех коннекторов, а на деле он был у двух из четырёх.
  Кэшируются только удачные ответы: запомнить сбой значило бы растянуть секундную
  помеху на весь TTL, а для Ozon кэш блокировки неотличим от настоящей.

**Запуск и развёртывание**
- HTTP-транспорт как опция (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http`). По умолчанию по-прежнему stdio,
  так что существующие конфиги клиентов работают без правок.
- Docker-образ и `compose`. Ограничения второго уровня Ozon в контейнере описаны
  честно, а не замазаны: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- `server.json` — манифест для реестра MCP-серверов.

**Инфраструктура**
- Измерение покрытия тестами в CI с порогом 70% (фактическое покрытие ветвей —
  74%, порог взят с запасом, чтобы не ломать сборку из-за постороннего шума).
- `check_untyped_defs` включён для `mcp_core`.
- Dependabot для `uv` и GitHub Actions.
- Релизный workflow: по тегу `v*` собираются wheels и sdist всех шести пакетов и
  прикладываются к релизу. Публикации в PyPI нет — имена пакетов ещё не решены.
- Шаблоны issue и PR, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, бейджи в README.

### Исправлено

- **Карточка Детского мира игнорировала регион.** Она не отправляла фильтр региона
  вообще, но подписывала ответ значением `DETMIR_REGION`. Из-за этого
  `store_count` всегда был 0, а ответ выглядел достоверным. Регион работает только
  через `filter=withregion:`; форма `?withregion=` принимается и молча
  игнорируется. Один и тот же товар: 152 магазина в Москве, 37 в Петербурге, 2 в
  Хабаровске.
- **Адаптер Ozon в сравнении цен был нерабочим.** Он читал поля `price_rub`,
  `reviews_count`, `feedbacks`, `name`, `id`, `brand` — ни одного из них нет в
  `OzonSearchItemOut`. Все молча превращались в `None`. Хуже: те поля, что он
  всё-таки находил, — это текст для показа (`1 234 ₽`, `4,8`), а `price_rub` в
  модели `float | None`, так что pydantic ронял валидацию и весь источник целиком.
- **Дубли в выдаче Яндекса.** Один товар может занимать несколько сниппетов на
  странице. Дедупликация идёт до применения `limit`, иначе дубль съедал часть
  запрошенного объёма без всяких пояснений.

### Изменено

- `MetaOut` и модели selfcheck переехали в `mcp_core.models`. Не одним плоским
  классом: у Яндекса есть поле `extraction`, у Детского мира — `cached`, и слить их
  значило бы удалить оба и сломать два контракта. Сериализованный JSON всех 37
  моделей побайтово совпадает с 1.0.0.
- Логика запросов Wildberries поднята в ядро как `get_text_budgeted`: общий
  дедлайн на всю операцию, ошибки возвращаются классифицированной строкой, а не
  бросаются, вежливая пауза соблюдается и перед повтором. Обратное направление
  (перевести WB на более слабый общий хелпер) означало бы регресс.
- Отображение товара WB в карточку было скопировано в трёх местах — теперь одно
  `_card_item_dict`. Правило `in_stock` живёт в одном месте: остаток без цены —
  это непродаваемая позиция, и назвать её доступной значило бы вывести мёртвый
  товар в самые дешёвые.
- Тесты `mcp_core.process` переехали из набора Ozon в `mcp-core`.
- Тестов стало 406 вместо 221.

### Не сделано намеренно

- **`ozon_seller`.** Реквизиты продавца Ozon — прямой аналог `wb_seller`, и спайк
  был. Путь верный, id продавца уже приходит в `ozon_card` как `seller.link`, но с
  датацентрового IP каждый запрос заканчивается 403 от анти-бота. Контрольная
  проверка показательнее самих попыток: уже работающий путь `/product/{id}/` падает
  точно так же — блокируют IP, а не адрес. Значит, эндпоинт почти наверняка живой,
  а вот **пути к полям никто не видел**. Писать парсер под неувиденную структуру —
  это придумать имена полей и отдать то, что случайно совпадёт. Инструмент,
  возвращающий правдоподобное название чужого юрлица, хуже отсутствующего:
  проверяют продавца ровно для того, чтобы отличить официальный магазин от
  похожего перекупщика. Шаблон URL и порядок проверки — в
  `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-26 (English)

Technical debt, functional gaps, and two new Wildberries tools. The 20 tool names
and signatures from 1.0.0 are untouched: MCP client configs depend on them, so this
release only adds.

### Added

- `wb_questions(imt_id, limit, skip, answered_only)` — buyer questions with seller
  answers. Verified live across six products before any code was written; the
  endpoint has three failure modes that each look like an empty result rather than
  an error (see `docs/ANTI_BOT.md`).
- `wb_category_products(shard, query, page, sort, dest)` — the products behind the
  `shard`/`query` selectors `wb_categories` already returned and nothing consumed.
- Per-call `region` on all four Detsky Mir tools, overriding `DETMIR_REGION`.
- `WB_CACHE_TTL`, `WB_PROXY`, `OZON_CACHE_TTL`, `OZON_PROXY` — the docs promised
  `*_PROXY` everywhere while only two connectors had it. Only successful reads are
  cached.
- Optional HTTP transport (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http`); stdio remains the default, so
  existing client configs keep working.
- Docker image and compose, with the Ozon tier-2 limitations documented rather than
  glossed over: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- `server.json` registry manifest.
- CI coverage gate at 70% (measured branch coverage is 74%), `check_untyped_defs`
  for `mcp_core`, Dependabot, a tag-triggered release workflow that builds wheels
  and sdists for all six packages, issue/PR templates, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, README
  badges.

### Fixed

- **`detmir_card` ignored the region entirely** — it sent no region filter but
  labelled the response with `DETMIR_REGION`, so `store_count` was always 0 while
  the answer looked authoritative. Only `filter=withregion:` works; `?withregion=`
  is accepted and silently ignored.
- **The compare connector's Ozon adapter could not work.** It read six field names
  `OzonSearchItemOut` does not declare, and the fields it did hit are display text
  (`1 234 ₽`, `4,8`) where `price_rub` is `float | None`, so pydantic failed
  validation and killed the whole source.
- **Duplicate products in Yandex search results**, deduped by `product_id` before
  the limit is applied so a repeat cannot eat the caller's page budget.

### Changed

- `MetaOut` and the selfcheck envelopes moved into `mcp_core.models` as base
  classes, not one flat class: Yandex adds `extraction`, Detsky Mir adds `cached`,
  and flattening would have deleted both. Serialized JSON for all 37 response
  models is byte-identical to 1.0.0.
- Wildberries' request logic was promoted into the core as `get_text_budgeted`
  (whole-operation deadline, classified error strings instead of exceptions, polite
  gate re-entered before each retry) rather than porting WB down to the weaker
  shared helper.
- The WB product-to-card mapping, previously copy-pasted three times, is one
  `_card_item_dict`.
- `mcp_core.process` tests moved out of the Ozon suite into `mcp-core`.
- 406 tests, up from 221.

### Deliberately not shipped

- **`ozon_seller`.** The path is right and the seller id already arrives via
  `ozon_card`'s `seller.link`, but every request from a datacenter IP ends in an
  anti-bot 403 — and the repo's already-working `/product/{id}/` path fails
  identically, which is what proves the IP is gated rather than the URL wrong. The
  endpoint is almost certainly live; the field paths are what nobody has seen.
  A seller tool returning a plausible name for the wrong legal entity is worse than
  no tool, since the only reason to look a seller up is telling an official store
  from a lookalike. Template and verification steps: `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-26

First public release. The project grew from two connectors into a uv workspace of
five MCP servers over a shared runtime.

### Added

**New marketplaces**
- **Yandex Market** connector (`yandex_search`, `yandex_card`, `yandex_selfcheck`).
  Reads the server-rendered widget state, since Yandex exposes no usable JSON API.
  Reports the everyday price and the Plus-subscriber price separately, plus the
  per-star rating distribution and server-rendered reviews.
- **Detsky Mir** connector (`detmir_card`, `detmir_category`, `detmir_categories`,
  `detmir_selfcheck`) over its anonymous public JSON API, including offline store
  availability.

**Cross-marketplace comparison**
- New `compare-connector` with `compare_prices` and `compare_sources`. Queries
  every installed marketplace concurrently, ranks offers by everyday price, and
  reports a per-source outcome so a partial result is never mistaken for a
  complete one. Subscription-only prices are excluded from ranking.

**New Wildberries tools**
- `wb_seller(supplier_id)` — registered legal entity, INN, KPP, OGRN, legal
  address and trademark behind a seller id.
- `wb_categories(root, max_depth)` — catalog tree with WB's own shard/query
  selectors, bounded so a response stays a usable size.

**Shared runtime (`mcp-core`)**
- `transport.http_tier` — polite rate limiting, capped bodies, and retries scoped
  to transport faults and gateway statuses (429 deliberately excluded).
- `transport.chrome_cdp` — the authenticated tier, generalised out of the Ozon
  connector and now cross-platform.
- `process` — cross-platform worker spawn/reap with an allowlisted child
  environment.
- `cache` — in-process TTL cache with concurrent-miss collapsing.
- Proxy support across connectors via `*_PROXY` or the standard proxy variables.

**Project infrastructure**
- uv workspace monorepo; each connector is an installable package with a console
  script (`wb-mcp`, `ozon-mcp`, `yandex-mcp`, `detmir-mcp`, `compare-mcp`).
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff, mypy and the test suite on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS against
  Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- `scripts/check_no_print.py` — fails the build on any stdout write in server
  code, since a stray `print()` corrupts the JSON-RPC stream.
- `scripts/start_chrome_cdp.sh` — Linux/macOS counterpart to the PowerShell
  launcher.
- Agent skill documentation for every connector.
- Test suite grown from 66 to 221 offline tests, including real trimmed fixtures
  for the Yandex SSR parser.

### Fixed

- **`wb_search` returned pages where nothing had a price.** It resolved ids through
  `search-goods.wildberries.ru`, which serves a stale index: for one live query
  every id it returned was a delisted SKU with `price: null`, while the v9 search
  endpoint returned 100 in-stock products with real prices. `wb_search` now reads
  `search.wb.ru` v9 directly — one request instead of two, 100 results per page
  instead of 30 — and keeps the old path as a flagged fallback.
- **Ozon's process teardown was Windows-only.** `taskkill` paths, creation flags
  and the child environment allowlist assumed Windows; the POSIX branch was
  untested and its test asserted a Windows path, so it could not pass on Linux or
  macOS. Now cross-platform, with both branches unit-tested on every OS.
- **`taskkill` could be redirected through the environment.** The system directory
  was resolved via `SystemRoot`/`WINDIR`, which any process able to set the
  environment could point elsewhere. Now resolved via `GetSystemDirectoryW` or a
  literal fallback.
- **Windows paths were built with forward slashes off-Windows.** Switched to
  `PureWindowsPath` so the Windows branch composes correct paths when exercised
  from a POSIX host.
- **POSIX-only calls broke type checking and tests on Windows.** `terminate_process_tree`
  referenced `os.killpg`, `os.getpgid` and `signal.SIGKILL` literally. Those names do
  not exist on Windows, so mypy failed there while passing on Linux, and the POSIX
  tests could not monkeypatch attributes the module lacked. The calls now go through
  `kill_process_group()`, which resolves them via `getattr` and raises cleanly where
  process groups are unavailable; the tests patch that function instead. CI now runs
  `mypy --platform win32` and `--platform darwin`, which is what would have caught this
  from a Linux host in the first place.
- **PEP 561 markers were missing.** Without `py.typed`, mypy treated every
  cross-package import as `Any` and reported phantom missing-return errors. All
  packages now ship the marker; the tree is mypy-clean.
- **Error bodies were truncated unconditionally.** Detsky Mir's search route
  answers 404 while rendering a full page, so an error-body cap discarded real
  content. The cap is now opt-out per call.
- **Gateway errors were not retried.** Detsky Mir emits sporadic 502s and Yandex
  occasionally answers 302 with an empty body; both are now retried, while 429 is
  still passed straight through.

### Removed

- **`detmir_search` was implemented, tested against live data, and deleted.** Its
  results were plausible-looking nonsense: a query for "лего" returned nappies and
  collagen supplements, because Detsky Mir's API ignores text filters and its
  website search route renders a promo carousel behind a 404. No search tool is
  better than a confidently wrong one; discovery goes through `detmir_categories`.

### Not included, and why

Marketplaces evaluated during this release and deliberately left out:

- **Megamarket** — its mobile API works, but ServicePipe blocks datacenter traffic
  outright and requires cookies from a browser that has passed a JS challenge.
- **Lamoda** — its GraphQL endpoint returns prices for a *known* SKU, but catalog
  and search sit behind an anti-bot redirect loop, so there is no way to discover
  products in the first place.
- **DNS** — Qrator serves a JavaScript proof-of-work challenge on all dynamic
  pages; only `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are reachable anonymously.
- **Citilink** — Qrator rate-blocks the entire domain, and the data transport is
  gRPC-web requiring a reversed protobuf schema.

Details in [docs/ANTI_BOT.md](docs/ANTI_BOT.md).
